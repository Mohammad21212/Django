The central Bank of Tanzania (BoT) began buying gold from local traders and miners in the last financial year that ended in June to boost its reserves amid depreciation pressure on the local currency, the shilling. In the 12 months to June, the   bought 418 kg of gold to beef up its reserves and in the current financial year it intends to buy 6 metric tons of gold. The regulator, the Tanzania Mining Commission, said late on Friday in a statement that the directive will take effect effectively on Oct. 1 as part of a newly enacted mining law. Miners and traders, according to the statement, will be required to submit the reserved gold to two major mineral refineries, Eye of Africa Ltd in the capital Dodoma and Mwanza Precious Metals Refinery Ltd, located in the lake city of Mwanza in the north of the East African country. ""All payments will be done according to the Bank of Tanzania arrangements,"" the statement said, without providing details on rates.

China's gold reserves unchanged for fifth straight month in September,"['markets', 'commodities', '']",", Reuters","Reporting by Qiaoyi Li, Ryan Woo and Casey Hall; Editing by Muralikumar Anantharaman & Shri Navaratnam","SHANGHAI, Oct 7 (Reuters) - China's central bank held back on buying gold for its reserves for a fifth straight month in September, official data showed on Monday, mainly due to a surge in prices for the yellow metal. China's gold holdings stood at 72.8 million troy ounces at the end of last month. The value of the gold reserves, however, rose to $191.47 billion from $182.98 billion at the end of August. Gold prices have risen around 28% so far this year - heading for the biggest annual gain in 14 years - underpinned by the start of U.S. Federal Reserve interest rate cuts, geopolitical tensions and robust demand from central banks. Global central banks, which actively bought gold in 2022-2023, are on track to slow purchases in 2024 from 2023, according to the World Gold Council, but to keep them above the pre-2022 level. This is partly due to the pause in purchases by the People's Bank of China (PBOC), which until May had bought gold for 18 consecutive months. The central bank was the world's largest official sector buyer of gold in 2023 and its decision to put its buying on hold muted Chinese   in recent months. ""With higher gold prices, the PBOC continues to pause from new purchases.

"Miners, investors see scope in energy transition but struggle with choices: Russell","['markets', 'commodities', '']",", Clyde Russell",Editing by Miral Fahmy,"SINGAPORE, Sept 25 (Reuters) - Mining investment conferences have a great track record of pointing to the next growth area for commodities, as they bring together early stage investors and junior miners seeking to get projects off the ground. A decade ago lithium was the popular metal, five years ago it was the turn of gold and more recently copper has been the flavour of the month at these events across Asia. But at the 121 Mining and Energy Investment conference this week in Singapore there was no clear choice, and no real consensus on where the best opportunities lie. If there was a broad theme, it was that the energy transition is real and happening, even if it will take place at varying speeds and in different forms across Asia, the world's most populous region and the engine room of global economic growth. But how best to leverage the energy transition into profitable investments is turning into a vexing challenge for both those with cash to splash and those seeking to develop projects aimed at accelerating the change to cleaner fuels and power systems. One of the surprising metals on the radar screen at the conference was lithium. It went out of favour in recent years after a surge in investment took the market into surplus, resulting in a collapse of prices, which have dropped some 88% since reaching a record high in December 2022. The thinking is that while the lithium market is currently oversupplied, and this may persist into 2025, there is a wave of new demand coming. Much of the bearishness surrounding lithium has been about the slower-than-expected uptake of electric vehicles in the developed world. But while sales may have been disappointing, lithium demand is set for strong increases in the next few years as electric heavy vehicles enter service, and as battery storage to firm renewables such as wind and solar become more widespread. It's this demand for lithium that will end up trumping any weakness in EV car sales, and it's set to accelerate strongly by 2030, which is coincidently around the time a mining company may be able to bring on new production assuming they started development soon. Another out of favour commodity is coal, but there was interest expressed in metallurgical, or coking coal, the higher quality fuel used mainly to make steel. In effect this is an India play, with the expectation that as it continues its massive infrastructure build out, the South Asian nation will also produce more steel, and thus need to import coking coal given the lack of domestic resources. While coal is the bogeyman of climate change, the view among some investors is that given the energy transition relies heavily on steel, coking coal can be acceptable given its role in producing steel. Steel can be de-carbonised by upgrading iron ore using green hydrogen and then using electric arc furnaces, but the view is that this will take several decades to reach the scale needed, and in the meantime the coal-intensive, traditional basic oxygen furnace method will dominate in India, as it does in China. Another part of the commodity complex attracting investor interest is the midstream sector, where raw materials are processed into intermediate goods. The desire of Western countries to diversify away from China's dominance of metal processing is unlocking opportunities, such as the capital available from the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act. The trick is navigating the bureaucratic processes behind the various global legislations, and even if the money can be accessed, it still may not be enough to overcome China's economies of scale and first mover advantages. For example, setting up a lithium processing plant in Australia, the world's biggest producer of the battery metal, is likely to come in at up to eight times the capital and operating cost of a similar operation in China. Accessing capital remains an ongoing struggle, with both investors and miners saying the pools of available capital are shrinking, especially if Chinese money is deemed politically unacceptable. This means that smaller projects are increasingly turning to intermediaries to obtain funding, such as global trading houses such as Glencore and Trafigura. Banks will lend to these well-established companies, and they in turn will lend to smaller-scale projects. But the problem with this process is that it increases the cost of capital and slows down the pace at which new projects can be brought on line. The bottom line is that the energy transition is viewed as offering huge opportunities to miners, traders and investors, but it remains plagued by uncertainty over which technologies will emerge as the leaders, and also the lack of coordinated government policies such as incentives and carbon taxes. The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters."
Western ETF investors poised to heap fuel on gold's record rally,"['markets', '']",", Ashitha Shivaprasad",Reporting by Ashitha Shivaprasad in Bengaluru; Editing by Veronica Brown and Sharon Singleton,"Sept 24 (Reuters) - Inflows into gold exchange-traded funds, particularly from Western investors, are set to rise in coming months, adding yet more positive stimulus for already record high bullion prices, analysts said. Gold prices have surged some 27% so far this year to vault $2,600 per ounce, benefiting directly from looser central bank monetary policy and pockets of geo-political tension.

Exchange Traded Products (ETPs), or Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs), allow investors to   to assets like gold without taking delivery. Any rise in holdings is significant for prices, as ETPs are backed by the physical commodity. Increased inflows will reduce the supply of precious metal available in the market, bolstering prices further. ""Now that the rate cutting cycle has commenced, we think ETP inflows are likely to accelerate, supporting the next leg higher in gold,"" Standard Chartered analyst Suki Cooper said. ""ETP flows, which typically have a stronger correlation with real yields and the dollar, have turned positive. The bulk of the inflows have come from Europe, but over the past two months, North America has led fresh interest.""

North America added inflows of 17.2 tonnes or $1.4 billion last month. Softer U.S. economic data, dovish Fed comments, declines in the dollar and yields, as well as lowering opportunity costs fueled inflows, the WGC added. This comes after gold ETFs had three straight years of outflows amid high global interest rates. The latest four months of inflows have only managed to trim the year-to-date losses to a net outflow of 44 metric tons.

Beijing's new measures include a planned 50 basis point cut to banks' reserve requirements. Major banks like J.P. Morgan, Goldman Sachs, Citi and UBS have reiterated their bullish stance on gold and forecast prices will move higher, with ETF holdings rising. ""Fed cuts are poised to bring Western capital back into gold ETFs, a component largely absent of the sharp gold rally observed in the last two years,"" Goldman Sachs said in a note. J.P. Morgan this week noted that retail-focused ETF builds will be key to a further sustained gold rally and projected prices to move towards a 2025 peak target of $2,850. Spot gold touched a record of $2,639.95 per ounce on Tuesday, driven by hopes of further monetary policy easing and  . Lower interest rates reduce the opportunity cost of holding the zero-yield bullion and it is considered a safe-asset amid turmoil.

"Reports of dollar's demise are greatly exaggerated, JPMorgan says","['markets', 'us', '']",", Marc Jones","Reporting by Marc Jones
Editing by Christina Fincher","LONDON, Sept 4 (Reuters) - Suggestions that the dollar's dominance of the global financial system is ending are wide of the mark, JPMorgan said on Wednesday, despite some dramatic signs of change in commodity markets and certain trading blocs. China's rise and the use of economic sanctions on the likes of Russia mean there is a trend of diversification away from the dollar, JPMorgan said, but reasons for the U.S. currency's dominance remain ""well-entrenched and structural in nature"". It pointed to the rising amounts of dollar-denominated bank deposits in emerging markets, sovereign wealth fund behaviour and non-reserve foreign assets, saying it ""more than offset"" the dollar's secular decline in overall emerging market FX reserve holdings. The dollar's share in total world liabilities is still on the rise too thanks to record amounts of debt issuance and even talk of de-dollarization in China appeared ""exaggerated"" despite geopolitical rivalry. ""Meaningful erosion of dollar dominance is likely to take decades, and the decline in the dollar's share of global trade and overall FX reserve holdings should not be confused with de-dollarization,"" the investment bank's report said. Areas where significant changes are happening include commodities markets where oil trading is increasingly done in non-USD currencies and demand from central banks and emerging market consumers for gold has boomed. The most ""underappreciated risk to USD hegemony"" was a possible fragmentation of the international payments system where the dollar has long been all powerful, the bank argued. China and India are the global leaders in terms of e-commerce innovation and activity whereas the U.S. and Western Europe's share is now less than 30%. Washington's use of tough financial sanctions means Russia, China and other countries are building alternatives to the SWIFT bank-to-bank system. Dozens of central banks are piloting new digital versions of their national currencies that could also make avoiding the U.S. banking system easier. ""The genuine confidence of the private sector in the dollar as a store of value seems uncontested,"" JPMorgan's report said. ""However, we are witnessing greater diversification and important shifts in cross-border transactions as a result of sanctions against Russia, China’s efforts to bolster usage of the renminbi, and geoeconomic fragmentation."""
Putin's commodities ban threat puzzles Russian firms and officials,"['markets', 'europe', '']",", Gleb Bryanski, ,  , Darya Korsunskaya,   , Gleb Stolyarov","Reporting by Gleb Bryanski, Dasha Korsunskaya, Gleb Stolyarov; writing by Gleb Bryanski; editing by Guy Faulconbridge and Kevin Liffey","MOSCOW, Sept 12 (Reuters) - Russian officials and managers are perplexed by President Vladimir Putin's   to limit exports of strategic commodities in response to Western sanctions, and wonder if it can be realised without hurting Russia more than the West. Putin made the suggestion 23 minutes into a routine government meeting on Wednesday, asking Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin to come up with some ideas that would not harm Russia's interests. Yet many of Russia's commodities such as oil, gas, nickel, titanium, gold and diamonds are already subject to various levels of voluntary or mandatory import restrictions or even bans imposed by the West itself. Russian government officials and company executives were caught off guard. ""Everyone is in a state of shock,"" said a source in one of the affected companies, who spoke on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of appearing to criticise the president. ""This initiative came really out of the blue."" Another company source said: ""It's like shooting yourself in the foot."" Cutting exports of uranium, nickel and titanium - which Putin mentioned explicitly - would cut the foreign currency earnings of Russia's biggest firms including state-owned industrial conglomerate Rostec, state nuclear monopoly Rosatom and Nornickel, the world's top producer of refined nickel. Together, they employ about a million people, and their revenues have already been affected by Western sanctions. Nornickel's   first-half profit fell by 22% as it tries to pivot its exports to Asia. It has described the combination of low nickel prices and Western sanctions as a ""perfect storm"". The global market price of nickel did blip upwards on Putin's comments - but the current wealth of supply means it is far below historic highs. A Russian government source, who also spoke on condition of anonymity, said any ban should spare so-called ""friendly"" countries including China, Russia's major trading partner. The source stressed that it would take some time for the government to develop the plan - and that an order from the president to do so had yet to reach the government. Another source close to the government added that Putin had ""asked for a plan to be worked out, not implemented"". Major Russian commodities producers declined to comment. Russia and the West are entering   over the Ukraine war and Russia is pondering ways to respond to what it says is almost certain Western approval for Ukraine to strike deep into Russia using Western weapons. Putin said that if Russia went ahead, the measure would not be limited to uranium, nickel and titanium. He noted that Russia has 22% of the world's natural gas reserves, 23% of gold reserves, and 55% of global diamond reserves. Uranium may be the one commodity where restrictions could genuinely hurt the West. Russia accounted for 27% of the enriched uranium supplied to U.S. commercial nuclear reactors last year. While the U.S. has in theory banned imports of the fuel from Russia, it also provided for waivers through 2027 as it expands its own enrichment facilities.

TSX notches record high as Fed easing boosts liquidity prospects,"['markets', '']",", Fergal Smith",Reporting by Fergal Smith in Toronto and Nikhil Sharma in Bengaluru; Editing by Leroy Leo and Alistair Bell,"Sept 19 (Reuters) - Canada's main stock index climbed to a record high on Thursday, led by technology and commodity-linked stocks, as investors bet that the Federal Reserve's outsized interest rate cut could spur a shift from cash into riskier assets globally.

How investors buy gold and what drives the market,"['markets', 'commodities', '']",", Reuters",Compiled by Bangalore Commodities and Energy Team; editing by Barbara Lewis,"Sept 20 (Reuters) -   hit a record high above $2,600 per ounce on Friday, as the prospect of more U.S. interest rate cuts and global geo-political uncertainty boosted its appeal. Bullion has risen more than 26% so far this year, and as market bulls lock in further gains, another milestone of $3,000 per ounce is in  . Here are the different avenues for investing in gold: Large buyers and institutional investors usually buy gold from big banks. Prices in the spot market are determined by real-time supply and demand dynamics. London is the most influential hub for the spot gold market, largely because of the London Bullion Market Association (LBMA). The LBMA sets standards for gold trading and provides a framework for the OTC (over-the-counter) market, facilitating trades among banks, dealers, and institutions. China, India, the Middle East and the United States are other major gold trading centres. Investors can also get exposure to gold via futures exchanges, where people buy or sell a particular commodity at a fixed price on a particular date in future. COMEX (Commodity Exchange Inc), a part of the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX), is the largest gold futures market in terms of trading volumes. Shanghai Futures Exchange, China's leading commodities exchange, also offers gold futures contracts. The Tokyo Commodity exchange, popularly known as TOCOM, is another big player in the Asian gold market. Exchange Traded Products (ETPs) or Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) issue securities backed by physical metal and allow people to gain exposure to the underlying gold prices without taking delivery of the metal itself. ETFs have become a major category of investment demand for the precious metal. Global physically backed gold ETFs attracted a fourth consecutive month of   in August after North American and Europe-listed funds increased holdings, the World Gold Council (WGC) said. Retail consumers can buy gold from metals traders selling bars and coins in an outlet or online. Both gold bars and coins are effective means of investing in physical gold. DRIVERS: Rising interest from investment funds in recent years has been a major factor behind bullion's price moves. Sentiment driven by market trends, news, and global events can also lead to speculative buying or selling of gold. Gold is a popular hedge against currency market volatility. It has traditionally moved in the opposite direction to the U.S. dollar as weakness in the U.S. unit makes dollar-priced gold cheaper for holders of other currencies and vice versa. The precious metal is widely considered a ""safe haven"", bought during uncertain times in a flight to quality. Major geopolitical events, such as extended conflicts in the   and   have added to uncertainties for global investors and burnished gold's appeal. Policy decisions from global central banks also influence gold's trajectory. Lower rates reduce the opportunity cost of holding gold, since it pays no interest. Gold's latest rally was triggered after the U.S. Federal Reserve began its   with an outsized half-percentage-point cut on Wednesday. Central banks hold gold as part of their reserves. Buying or selling of the metal by the banks can influence prices. Central bank demand has been robust in recent years because of ongoing macroeconomic and political uncertainty, analysts have said. More central banks plan to add to their gold reserves within a year despite high prices for the precious metal, the World Gold Council (WGC) said in its annual survey in June."

"India's trade deficit widens in August on spike in gold imports, weak exports","['world', 'india', '']",", Shivangi Acharya,   , Manoj Kumar","Reporting by Shivangi Acharya; Additional reporting by Rajendra Jadhav in MUMBAI; Editing by Nivedita Bhattacharjee, Alexandra Hudson","NEW DELHI, Sept 17 (Reuters) - India's merchandise trade deficit in August widened to a ten-month high of $29.65 billion after gold imports surged while exports fell, dragged down by climbing shipping costs and sluggish global demand. Economists had expected the country's August trade deficit to be $23 billion, according to a Reuters poll. The deficit stood at $23.5 billion in the previous month. ""Exports are facing huge challenges on current global circumstances,"" Trade Secretary Sunil Barthwal told reporters, in regard to the monthly trade data. Rising shipping costs and a slowdown in China coupled with recessionary trends in Europe and the US were also impacting exports, he said. Outbound shipments from the world's fifth-largest economy fell 9.3% year-on-year, for the second month in a row, to $34.71 billion last month, data showed, while imports increased by 3.3% to $64.36 billion. Monthly gold imports in August surged more than three times to $10.06 billion compared to the previous month, partly due to an increase in domestic demand, a senior commerce ministry official said. In value terms, August gold imports were the highest since March 2021, when they had touched $8.5 billion, according to Reuters calculations. Gold imports through official channels have also gone up after a cut in the import tariff to 6% from 15% in the budget in July, discouraging gold smuggling, the official said. Services exports in August were estimated at $30.69 billion, and imports at $15.70 billion, compared with $28.71 billion and $15.09 billion, respectively, a year ago. India's total goods and services exports for the fiscal year 2023/24, which ended in March, stood at nearly $776 billion while imports for the same period were nearly $855 billion. Exporters said Indian goods exports have been impacted by the escalating US-China trade war and rising freight costs, besides a fall in global commodity prices. ""Freight costs for Indian exporters' shipping goods to Europe and the U.S. have more than doubled in the past year, driven by disruptions in the Red Sea,"" said Ajay Srivastava, founder of the Delhi-based think tank Global Trade Research Initiative. The think-tank has urged the government to take steps to strengthen domestic shipping lines and container production, noting that over 90% of India's merchandise exports were dependent on global carriers like Maersk [RIC:RIC:APMOLM.UL], MSC and COSCO [RIC:RIC:COSCO.UL]. The  , in a report earlier this month, urged the Indian government to reduce import tariffs and integrate into global value chains to boost exports, noting the country's manufacturing firms had not fully seized opportunities from China's exit from these sectors. The trade secretary said the trade deficit was not a matter of concern for an emerging economy like India. ""There is a huge consumption demand coming from the economy, which is growing at double the rate of other countries,"" Barthwal said."

Exclusive: Russia payment hurdles with China partners intensified in August,"['business', 'finance', '']",", Reuters",Reporting by Reuters in Moscow; Editing by Elisa Martinuzzi and Susan Fenton,"MOSCOW, Aug 30 (Reuters) - Some Russian companies are facing growing delays and rising costs on payments with trading partners in China, leaving transactions worth tens of billions of yuan in limbo, Russian sources with direct knowledge of the issue told Reuters. Russian companies and   for a few months have pointed to delays in transactions after Chinese banks tightened compliance following   of secondary sanctions for dealing with Russia. The sources said the problem has intensified this month. Chinese state banks are shutting down transactions with Russia ""en masse"" and billions of yuan worth of payments are held up, a source close to the government, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told Reuters. China is Russia's largest trading partner, accounting for a third of Russia's foreign trade last year and supplying items such as vital industrial equipment and consumer goods that help Russia weather Western sanctions. It also provides a lucrative market for many Russian exports that China relies on, from oil and gas to agricultural products. After the U.S. Treasury in June   secondary sanctions on banks in China and other countries for dealing with Russia, Chinese banks started to take a very strict stance on transactions, said a source at one of Russia's leading e-commerce platforms. It sells a wide variety of consumer goods imported from China. ""At that moment, all cross-border payments to China stopped. We found solutions, but it took about three weeks, which is a very long time, trade volumes fell drastically during that time,"" said the source. One working solution was to buy gold, move it to Hong Kong and sell it there, depositing cash in a local bank account, the person said. Sources told Reuters that some Russian businesses have been using chains of intermediaries in third countries to handle their transactions and get around compliance checks run by Chinese banks. As a result, costs to process transactions have risen to as much as 6% of transaction payments, from close to zero before, they said. The sources spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter. ""For many small companies, this means a complete shutdown,"" another source close to the government said. The Kremlin acknowledged the problem but said that economic cooperation is important for both countries and that solutions will be found. ""With such volumes and in such an unfriendly environment, it is impossible to avoid some problematic situations,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said in a statement to Reuters. ""However, the truly partnership spirit of our relations allows us to discuss and resolve current issues constructively,"" he said. Transactions with China are not of grave concern to top Russian leadership, however, because payments in priority areas are still proceeding smoothly, and there is political will from both sides, a banking source told Reuters.Bilateral arrangements for large companies, such as Russia's commodity exporters and China's exporters of vital technologies, still work well, whereas smaller companies trading in consumer goods experience problems, sources said. Russian exporters haven't experienced difficulties in receiving payments for commodities that China imports, such as oil or grain, another source close to the Russian government told Reuters. Bilateral trade between Russia and China grew by 1.6% to $137 billion in the first half of 2024, according to China's official customs data, after hitting a record high $240 billion in 2023. ""Normal trade between China and Russia is consistent with WTO rules and market principles, is not directed against third parties and is not subject to interference or coercion by third parties,"" a Chinese foreign ministry spokesman told Reuters. ""We firmly oppose any illegal unilateral sanctions and ""long-arm jurisdiction"" and will take all necessary measures to safeguard our legitimate rights and interests,"" the spokesman added. Russia's imports from China fell by more than 1% to $62 billion in January-July 2024 due to payment problems, according to China's official statistics. Russia's central bank forecasts the country's total imports from around the world will fall by as much as 3% this year. ""Imports will decrease in 2024 due to the strengthening of sanctions barriers related to payments and logistics,"" the central bank said, although it predicted that the situation would improve in the medium term, according to draft monetary policy guidelines published on Aug. 29.After Russian President Vladimir Putin's visit to China in May, some   without a global business stepped in to handle bilateral payments. They would be out of the reach of Western sanctions enforcers. However, sources pointed out that these banks often had outdated IT systems and lacked staff with the necessary skills. The banking source said that cross-border couriers were shuttling transfer papers across the Russia-China border to get them physically stamped and signed by Chinese bankers. ""Until issues with payments are resolved at the state level, we cannot expect a dynamic inflow of investments from China,"" said Kirill Babaev, head of the China Institute at the Russian Academy of Sciences. Research co-authored by Babaev and released this month highlights the risks posed to Russia's industrial sector where China has become a leading supplier. ""In today's situation, payment problems with Chinese banks particularly exacerbate this challenge, as there are no other major suppliers of many types of industrial equipment besides China at present,"" the research paper said. Large companies in China as well as India are heavily dependent on American and European markets, Dmitry Birichevski, head of the economic department at Russia's foreign ministry, said at a conference in Moscow on Aug. 16. ""And they are being told, 'Guys, if you continue to work with Russia, we will cut off your access to our market and choke off your oxygen supply',"" he said."

Cryptoverse: Trump's bitcoin stockpile plan stirs debate,"['technology', '']",", Medha Singh,   , Lisa Pauline Mattackal",Reporting by Lisa Mattackal and Medha Singh in Bengaluru; Graphic by Sumanta Sen; Editing by Pravin Char,"Aug 6 (Reuters) - (This Aug. 6 story has been refiled to correct to 'Rahul,' not 'Raoul,' in paragraph 19) ""Never sell your bitcoin,"" Donald Trump told a cheering crowd at a crypto convention in Nashville, Tennessee in late July. The Republican presidential candidate's   was the latest overture in his effort to court crypto-focused voters ahead of November's election and offered a bevy of campaign promises, including a plan for a state bitcoin reserve. ""If elected, it will be the policy of my administration to keep 100% of all the bitcoin the U.S. government currently holds or acquires into the future,"" Trump said, adding the funds would serve as the ""core of the strategic national bitcoin stockpile."" Indeed, Trump isn't the only one with such a proposal. U.S. Senator   has introduced legislation that would see the U.S. government purchase one million bitcoin, around 5% of total supply, while independent candidate Robert F Kennedy Jr has suggested a government stockpile of four million bitcoin. A strategic reserve would be one use for the massive amount of bitcoin held by the U.S. government. The jury's out on what it would be used for, whether it's feasible, or if it's even welcome for the broader crypto market, though. The U.S. government holds a bumper cache of crypto: around $11.1 billion worth which includes 203,239 bitcoin tokens, according to data firm Arkham Intelligence which said the pile came from criminal seizures, including from online marketplace Silk Road, which was shut down in 2013. At current levels, the U.S. holds about 1% of overall global bitcoin supply - which stands at about 19.7 million tokens, according to Blockchain.com. Bitcoin's total supply is capped at 21 million coins. To compare against big non-state investors, Michael Saylor's Microstrategy   holds about 226,500 bitcoin tokens, as per second-quarter results. BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust   and Grayscale Bitcoin Trust   hold 344,070 and 240,140 tokens respectively, according to data site BitcoinTreasuries. A government bitcoin stockpile could shore up bitcoin's price. ""It would have a positive impact on price. It would have to because we've never had such a limited supply commodity, albeit digital, assume a new state of a reserve asset,"" said Mark Connors, head of global macro at Onramp Bitcoin. Yet such a reserve also means fewer tokens for crypto investors to trade with and could leave them exposed if the government ever sold part of its reserves. ""RFK talked about having 19% of bitcoin, the same amount of the gold supply - I can't imagine a single bitcoiner would be happy about that,"" Connors added. Governments besides the United States also boast bumper hoards of bitcoin, with BitcoinTreasuries reporting China is the second largest government holder, with 190,000 coins. While the prospect of a national bitcoin reserve is uncertain, crypto watchers are nonetheless pondering what form it could take. Connors suggested the Federal Reserve could manage the reserves for the Treasury Department, as it does with gold. On the other hand, the stockpile could be more akin to the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, where both the president and Congress have varying amounts of control, according to Frank Kelly, senior political strategist at asset manager DWS Group. ""There's a lot to parse and figure out there,"" Kelly said. There's also an irony that jars with many true bitcoin believers: the digital asset intended to be decentralized and free of government control becoming part of a state reserve. Regardless of what happens with a bitcoin stockpile, many market players are happy enough to see crypto becoming a significant campaign talking point. ""There's a general view in the industry that both parties are paying much more attention to digital assets,"" said Rahul Mewawalla, CEO of Mawson Infrastructure Group   which operates data centers for bitcoin mining. ""The expectation is that will continue post November."""

Fed's Powell defends central bank independence as challenges loom,"['business', 'finance', '']",", Michael S. Derby",Reporting by Michael S. Derby and Ann Saphir; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama and Andrea Ricci,"NEW YORK, July 9 (Reuters) - Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said on Tuesday central bank independence is a proven and politically popular way to achieve the best possible outcomes for the U.S. economy. “The record is pretty clear” that a central bank that operates outside of political factors and direction is “a good institutional arrangement that serves the public well,"" Powell said, adding ""as long as it's seen to serve the public well, it’s a good choice."" Powell's comments came during testimony on monetary policy and the economy given before the Senate's Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs. Powell flagged the ubiquity of independence at central banks among major economies, where the institutions are afforded latitude to achieve their respective mandates without being directed to do so by political authorities. A key aspect of independence is that it gives central banks space to make difficult choices when it comes to managing inflation. That bears on the near-term choices that now lie ahead for the Fed. With its short-term interest rate target at the highest level in decades, officials are searching for evidence that will allow them to cut rates as price pressures ease. That decision puts them potentially on track to ease just ahead of the presidential election in November, which would be highly contentious in political terms. Fed independence issues have loomed back into focus amid a presidential election season that could return Donald Trump to the White House. When Trump was president he repeatedly attacked the Fed for its monetary policy choices, breaking from decades of presidents steering clear from actively lobbying the Fed over how to set interest rate policy. Economists and other experts generally agree that political pressure on central banks leads to worse outcomes for the economy, especially on the inflation front. Powell told senators ""the results are clear"" that when a central bank can tackle its goals free of political direction ""you have better-anchored inflation expectations and you have better performance on inflation and better performance in the economy generally."" In his formal remarks Powell also noted that independence grants the Fed space to take a ""longer-term perspective"" on policy choices. Powell said that among elected officials, the benefit of Fed independence ""is pretty broadly understood and particularly on Capital Hill."" Senator Kevin Cramer, a Republican, told Powell he agreed. ""At least on Capitol Hill, we're all pretty much united"" on the importance of Fed independence, while acknowledging some moves within his own party to rein in Fed powers, something he said he had worked to counter. But he warned Powell on a pre-election rate cut, saying ""perception matters, and so I would just submit to you ...any move to lower interest rates or move interest rates either direction before November 5th could certainly be a bad perception."" The rising threat to Fed independence has driven the central bank to increasingly defend the value of the status in both public comments and in official communications. The central bank's   released last Friday included a section on the value of independence, for example. ""In an era of economic populism, and the possible advent of a second Trump administration, the idea of central bank independence is far more important than is commonly understood or appreciated among elected actors and the public,"" said Joseph Brusuelas, chief economist of consulting firm RSM US LLP. The issue of how Trump would approach Fed independence if returned to the presidency has been given additional urgency in the wake of what's called  , a Heritage Foundation organized effort created and overseen by a number of former Trump administration staffers. One of the views it espouses is that ""public opinion expressed through the lawmaking process in the Constitution should ultimately determine the monetary-institutional order in a free society."" The project calls for the Fed moving to an inflation-only legal mandate, dropping its directive to also promote strong job growth. It also supports curtailing the Fed's emergency lending powers and shrinking the Fed's   to levels seen in 2008 when the global financial crisis struck. Project 2025 even nods toward more radical changes including a possible shift to commodity-based money like gold or silver, and the possible abolition of the Fed itself. The report said at a ""minimum"" there should be a commission ""to explore the mission of the Federal Reserve, alternatives to the Federal Reserve system, and the nation’s financial regulatory apparatus."""
"Exclusive: Traders face $1 billion loss on faltering Ghana cocoa supply, sources say","['markets', 'commodities', '']",", Maytaal Angel,   , Maxwell Akalaare Adombila","Reporting by Maytaal Angel in London, Maxwell Akalaari Adombile in Accra, and Ange Aboa in Abidjan; Editing by Dmitry Zhdannikov and Emelia Sithole-Matarise","LONDON/ACCRA, July 15 (Reuters) - Trading houses face losses of at least $1 billion on cocoa derivatives after major producer Ghana failed to deliver beans this year, forcing traders to liquidate short positions in a rallying market, six industry sources told Reuters. Global cocoa prices soared this year after bad weather, bean disease, smuggling and illegal gold mining reduced production and the volume of beans available in Ghana, the world's No.2 producer. Chocolate prices also rose globally and chocolate makers have reduced the size of products such as bars as a result of the huge cocoa price increase. Ghanaian authorities, who sell all of the country's beans, want to delay delivery of up to   this season - nearly half of the cocoa beans they sold - due to Ghana's devastated crop, five sources told Reuters last month. Ghana's cocoa regulator said the country was looking to roll over ""some volumes, but not in those quantities"". A delay of 350,000 tons means cocoa traders and processors could face losses of about $4,000 per ton on cocoa futures they had bought to hedge their physical bean purchases, or around $1.4 billion combined, the sources said. Trade houses like Cargill [RIC:RIC:CARG.UL], Olam   and Barry Callebaut   use the futures market to hedge or lock in a price for cocoa they have not yet sold on to chocolate makers. ""We're sitting staring at our screens, barely trading,"" said the head cocoa trader at a global trading house specialising in agricultural commodities, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorised to talk to the media. He said trading in the global cocoa physical and futures market has just about ground to a halt as a result of the deep losses and uncertainty. Much of Ghana's cocoa is bought by large, diversified trade houses with deep pockets, including Sucden, Olam, Barry Callebaut  , Cargill, Touton and Ecom. Traders typically sign deals to buy beans - like any other commodity - months in advance in the hope of reselling later at a profit. By doing so they take a so called long position in the physical market. As they wait for the physical commodity to be delivered for weeks or months they need to protect themselves against possible price falls. They typically do this by taking short positions in the futures market to protect against losses on a long position. Short trading bets on price falls so when the physical commodity arrives, long and short positions cancel each other out, guaranteeing a fixed price. The strategy unravels, however, if physical delivery - in this case cocoa beans - is delayed in a rallying market. If this happens, traders are forced to liquidate short positions for the month they had expected the commodity to arrive and take a new short position for the month of a new expected delivery. Doing so in April 2024 - after the market realised Ghana would delay bean delivery to 2025 - would have been costly, according to the traders. The six sources said last year traders who bought physical beans for May 2024 delivery would have taken equivalent short positions in May 2024 futures at around $3,000 a ton. With the market rallying in April 2024, those traders had to liquidate May 2024 shorts - or buy the futures back - at $11,000 a ton, facing losses of $8,000 a ton. As traders still hope to get the cocoa and need to protect themselves in the physical market, they had to take on new short positions for May 2025 delivery, which in April 2024 traded around $7,000 a ton. That means that if and when traders get their physical cocoa next May at $3,000 a ton, they will still face an aggregate loss of $4,000 per ton. The cocoa market is facing a third successive year of deficit and prices have roughly doubled this year. Traders will try to recoup at least some of their losses by charging chocolate makers like Hershey   and Mondelez   higher prices for products like cocoa powder and butter, said a top trader at a global agri-commodity trade house. Chocolate firms will likely struggle to pass on these costs to cash-strapped consumers who are already buying   in response to price rises. Market liquidity has also decreased because of exchanges asking traders to post more cash as collateral to cover their hedges, one of the traders said. This liquidity crunch has fuelled price fluctuations or volatility, he added. The collateral, known as a margin call, is set by the futures exchange as a down payment that covers a portion of the potential losses traders might face on their futures position. The higher the futures price, the higher the margin calls."
