China's gold reserves unchanged for fifth straight month in September,"['markets', 'commodities', '']",", Reuters","Reporting by Qiaoyi Li, Ryan Woo and Casey Hall; Editing by Muralikumar Anantharaman & Shri Navaratnam","SHANGHAI, Oct 7 (Reuters) - China's central bank held back on buying gold for its reserves for a fifth straight month in September, official data showed on Monday, mainly due to a surge in prices for the yellow metal. China's gold holdings stood at 72.8 million troy ounces at the end of last month. The value of the gold reserves, however, rose to $191.47 billion from $182.98 billion at the end of August. Gold prices have risen around 28% so far this year - heading for the biggest annual gain in 14 years - underpinned by the start of U.S. Federal Reserve interest rate cuts, geopolitical tensions and robust demand from central banks. Global central banks, which actively bought gold in 2022-2023, are on track to slow purchases in 2024 from 2023, according to the World Gold Council, but to keep them above the pre-2022 level. This is partly due to the pause in purchases by the People's Bank of China (PBOC), which until May had bought gold for 18 consecutive months. The central bank was the world's largest official sector buyer of gold in 2023 and its decision to put its buying on hold muted Chinese   in recent months. ""With higher gold prices, the PBOC continues to pause from new purchases. We believe the central bank would like more gold but is waiting for a more attractive entry point,"" said WisdomTree commodity strategist Nitesh Shah. ""However, with global interest rates falling and geopolitical tensions rising, it looks like they may have to wait for some time for a price dip. Given our forecast of prices rising to over $3,000/oz in the coming year, the central bank may want to consider building positions earlier."""

"Miners, investors see scope in energy transition but struggle with choices: Russell","['markets', 'commodities', '']",", Clyde Russell",Editing by Miral Fahmy,"SINGAPORE, Sept 25 (Reuters) - Mining investment conferences have a great track record of pointing to the next growth area for commodities, as they bring together early stage investors and junior miners seeking to get projects off the ground. A decade ago lithium was the popular metal, five years ago it was the turn of gold and more recently copper has been the flavour of the month at these events across Asia. But at the 121 Mining and Energy Investment conference this week in Singapore there was no clear choice, and no real consensus on where the best opportunities lie. If there was a broad theme, it was that the energy transition is real and happening, even if it will take place at varying speeds and in different forms across Asia, the world's most populous region and the engine room of global economic growth. But how best to leverage the energy transition into profitable investments is turning into a vexing challenge for both those with cash to splash and those seeking to develop projects aimed at accelerating the change to cleaner fuels and power systems. One of the surprising metals on the radar screen at the conference was lithium. It went out of favour in recent years after a surge in investment took the market into surplus, resulting in a collapse of prices, which have dropped some 88% since reaching a record high in December 2022. The thinking is that while the lithium market is currently oversupplied, and this may persist into 2025, there is a wave of new demand coming. Much of the bearishness surrounding lithium has been about the slower-than-expected uptake of electric vehicles in the developed world. But while sales may have been disappointing, lithium demand is set for strong increases in the next few years as electric heavy vehicles enter service, and as battery storage to firm renewables such as wind and solar become more widespread. It's this demand for lithium that will end up trumping any weakness in EV car sales, and it's set to accelerate strongly by 2030, which is coincidently around the time a mining company may be able to bring on new production assuming they started development soon. Another out of favour commodity is coal, but there was interest expressed in metallurgical, or coking coal, the higher quality fuel used mainly to make steel. In effect this is an India play, with the expectation that as it continues its massive infrastructure build out, the South Asian nation will also produce more steel, and thus need to import coking coal given the lack of domestic resources. While coal is the bogeyman of climate change, the view among some investors is that given the energy transition relies heavily on steel, coking coal can be acceptable given its role in producing steel. Steel can be de-carbonised by upgrading iron ore using green hydrogen and then using electric arc furnaces, but the view is that this will take several decades to reach the scale needed, and in the meantime the coal-intensive, traditional basic oxygen furnace method will dominate in India, as it does in China. Another part of the commodity complex attracting investor interest is the midstream sector, where raw materials are processed into intermediate goods. The desire of Western countries to diversify away from China's dominance of metal processing is unlocking opportunities, such as the capital available from the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act. The trick is navigating the bureaucratic processes behind the various global legislations, and even if the money can be accessed, it still may not be enough to overcome China's economies of scale and first mover advantages. For example, setting up a lithium processing plant in Australia, the world's biggest producer of the battery metal, is likely to come in at up to eight times the capital and operating cost of a similar operation in China. Accessing capital remains an ongoing struggle, with both investors and miners saying the pools of available capital are shrinking, especially if Chinese money is deemed politically unacceptable. This means that smaller projects are increasingly turning to intermediaries to obtain funding, such as global trading houses such as Glencore and Trafigura. Banks will lend to these well-established companies, and they in turn will lend to smaller-scale projects. But the problem with this process is that it increases the cost of capital and slows down the pace at which new projects can be brought on line. The bottom line is that the energy transition is viewed as offering huge opportunities to miners, traders and investors, but it remains plagued by uncertainty over which technologies will emerge as the leaders, and also the lack of coordinated government policies such as incentives and carbon taxes.

Spot silver - both an investment asset due to its relationship with gold and an industrial metal - rose to $32.71 per ounce on Thursday, its highest since December 2012, and has gained more than 35% so far in 2024, leading the precious metals complex.

""China stimulus is giving industrial metals a boost, something silver traders had been waiting for,"" Ole Hansen, head of commodity strategy at Saxo Bank, said. ""Continued gold strength combined with stable to higher industrial metal prices should see silver continue to outperform gold, with the gold/silver ratio falling back towards the 70 to 75 area, potentially driving a 10% outperformance in silver,"" Hansen added. The gold-silver ratio, denoting how many ounces of silver one ounce of gold can buy, is used by the market to gauge future trends as it indicates silver's current performance against its historical correlation with gold. ""Interest rate cuts should provide a bullish impulse for global activity and support silver consumption. We see prices rising to $35 over the next 3 months and $38 over the next 6-12 months,"" Citi analyst Max Layton said. Macquarie, which expects that silver market deficits will persist throughout its 5-year forecast window, said investor flows are likely to remain key for near-term price action, with ETF holdings arguably offering the greatest scope for support. However, consolidation in China's solar industry and slower growth in the world's second biggest economy could pose headwinds for silver in the near-term. ""China's newest support measures on their own will probably be insufficient to drive a turnaround in growth and traders do appear to be overestimating the likelihood of another 50 bps cut by the Fed in November,"" said Hamad Hussain, assistant climate & commodities economist at Capital Economics. ""Accordingly, the rally in silver prices is unlikely to be sustained over the next few months as some of the tailwinds boosting silver demand fade."" In top consumer China, industrial output growth slowed to a five-month low in August, underlining weakening domestic demand.

Western ETF investors poised to heap fuel on gold's record rally,"['markets', '']",", Ashitha Shivaprasad",Reporting by Ashitha Shivaprasad in Bengaluru; Editing by Veronica Brown and Sharon Singleton,"Sept 24 (Reuters) - Inflows into gold exchange-traded funds, particularly from Western investors, are set to rise in coming months, adding yet more positive stimulus for already record high bullion prices, analysts said. Gold prices have surged some 27% so far this year to vault $2,600 per ounce, benefiting directly from looser central bank monetary policy and pockets of geo-political tension. Interest rate cutting cycles in the U.S., Europe and latterly China, have fanned bullish sentiment, with players focused on further gains including another record milestone of  . Exchange Traded Products (ETPs), or Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs), allow investors to   to assets like gold without taking delivery. Any rise in holdings is significant for prices, as ETPs are backed by the physical commodity. Increased inflows will reduce the supply of precious metal available in the market, bolstering prices further. ""Now that the rate cutting cycle has commenced, we think ETP inflows are likely to accelerate, supporting the next leg higher in gold,"" Standard Chartered analyst Suki Cooper said. ""ETP flows, which typically have a stronger correlation with real yields and the dollar, have turned positive. The bulk of the inflows have come from Europe, but over the past two months, North America has led fresh interest."" According to the   (WGC), global gold ETFs saw inflows of 28.5 tonnes, or $2.1 billion, in August with all regions reporting positive flows while western funds contributed the lion’s share. North America added inflows of 17.2 tonnes or $1.4 billion last month. Softer U.S. economic data, dovish Fed comments, declines in the dollar and yields, as well as lowering opportunity costs fueled inflows, the WGC added. This comes after gold ETFs had three straight years of outflows amid high global interest rates. The latest four months of inflows have only managed to trim the year-to-date losses to a net outflow of 44 metric tons.

""Fed cuts are poised to bring Western capital back into gold ETFs, a component largely absent of the sharp gold rally observed in the last two years,"" Goldman Sachs said in a note. J.P. Morgan this week noted that retail-focused ETF builds will be key to a further sustained gold rally and projected prices to move towards a 2025 peak target of $2,850.

Lower interest rates reduce the opportunity cost of holding the zero-yield bullion and it is considered a safe-asset amid turmoil.

How investors buy gold and what drives the market,"['markets', 'commodities', '']",", Reuters",Compiled by Bangalore Commodities and Energy Team; editing by Barbara Lewis,"Sept 20 (Reuters) -   hit a record high above $2,600 per ounce on Friday, as the prospect of more U.S. interest rate cuts and global geo-political uncertainty boosted its appeal. Bullion has risen more than 26% so far this year, and as market bulls lock in further gains, another milestone of $3,000 per ounce is in  . Here are the different avenues for investing in gold: Large buyers and institutional investors usually buy gold from big banks. Prices in the spot market are determined by real-time supply and demand dynamics. London is the most influential hub for the spot gold market, largely because of the London Bullion Market Association (LBMA). The LBMA sets standards for gold trading and provides a framework for the OTC (over-the-counter) market, facilitating trades among banks, dealers, and institutions. China, India, the Middle East and the United States are other major gold trading centres. Investors can also get exposure to gold via futures exchanges, where people buy or sell a particular commodity at a fixed price on a particular date in future. COMEX (Commodity Exchange Inc), a part of the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX), is the largest gold futures market in terms of trading volumes. Shanghai Futures Exchange, China's leading commodities exchange, also offers gold futures contracts. The Tokyo Commodity exchange, popularly known as TOCOM, is another big player in the Asian gold market. Exchange Traded Products (ETPs) or Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) issue securities backed by physical metal and allow people to gain exposure to the underlying gold prices without taking delivery of the metal itself. ETFs have become a major category of investment demand for the precious metal. Global physically backed gold ETFs attracted a fourth consecutive month of   in August after North American and Europe-listed funds increased holdings, the World Gold Council (WGC) said. Retail consumers can buy gold from metals traders selling bars and coins in an outlet or online. Both gold bars and coins are effective means of investing in physical gold. DRIVERS: Rising interest from investment funds in recent years has been a major factor behind bullion's price moves. Sentiment driven by market trends, news, and global events can also lead to speculative buying or selling of gold. Gold is a popular hedge against currency market volatility. It has traditionally moved in the opposite direction to the U.S. dollar as weakness in the U.S. unit makes dollar-priced gold cheaper for holders of other currencies and vice versa. The precious metal is widely considered a ""safe haven"", bought during uncertain times in a flight to quality. Major geopolitical events, such as extended conflicts in the   and   have added to uncertainties for global investors and burnished gold's appeal. Policy decisions from global central banks also influence gold's trajectory. Lower rates reduce the opportunity cost of holding gold, since it pays no interest. Gold's latest rally was triggered after the U.S. Federal Reserve began its   with an outsized half-percentage-point cut on Wednesday. Central banks hold gold as part of their reserves. Buying or selling of the metal by the banks can influence prices. Central bank demand has been robust in recent years because of ongoing macroeconomic and political uncertainty, analysts have said. More central banks plan to add to their gold reserves within a year despite high prices for the precious metal, the World Gold Council (WGC) said in its annual survey in June."
The Brazilian farmers who are trying to keep the world in its coffee habit despite climate change,"['sustainability', '']",", Terry Slavin",Thomson Reuters,"September 16 - Marcelo Montanari likes to say he was born under a coffee tree. In the four generations that his family has farmed coffee in Brazil after emigrating from Italy 130 years ago, the Motanaris had to relocate four times, when farming became unviable for either political or climate reasons. The last move, to the Cerrado Mineiro region of Minas Gerais, was in 1975, when frost wiped out the crop in the state of Parana, then one of the country’s largest coffee-growing areas. It was an event felt by coffee lovers around the world as the price of their daily java doubled. Arabica coffee is second only to petroleum as the most valuable traded and consumed commodity worldwide. Unlike petroleum, however, there is no risk of flagging demand in the future, with burgeoning middle classes in Asia fast developing a coffee habit. In China, for example, coffee imports grew 30% in the first half of this year alone. And Montanari and his neighbours are at the heart of its production, with Brazil supplying almost half of the world’s demand, most of it from the Cerrado, a vast high savannah where coffee is harvested mechanically on plantations of up to 1,000 hectares – unlike the small plots where it is laboriously handpicked by smallholders in mountainous countries like Colombia. Yet the crop is everywhere under an   as climate change causes extreme weather events and rainfall becomes more erratic, playing havoc with yields. Areas suitable for coffee could  according to climate simulations, and arabica is most at risk, requiring temperatures between 18 degrees Celsius and 23C, and altitudes between 1,000 and 2,000 metres. That puts Cerrado Mineiro, where coffee is grown at altitudes of 900-1,250m, at the lower edge of viability, as I learned on a press trip with Nespresso to the region last September. But 44-year-old Montanari, who trained as an agronomist 20 years ago, is determined not to move again, and believes the key to bolstering the climate-resilience of his coffee crops is through regenerative agriculture. For the past 10 years he has worked to introduce regenerative methods on his 250-hectare farm, dramatically reducing the use of chemical fertilisers and pesticides by replacing them with biological alternatives and integrated pest management. Under , it’s mandatory for the country’s landowners to keep 20% of their property for natural vegetation, but on Montanari’s farm, it is nearly double that, at 36%. While coffee is grown in the full sun, rows of coffee plants are interspersed with native trees, including indigenous mahogany trees, which are commercially valuable, and give him a financial buffer. More importantly, the trees he has planted provide critically important resilience to the drought conditions that the region has been experiencing, Montanari says, with 30 days of water reserves in his ponds, far more than neighbours who are using traditional methods. “We take a holistic view with everything we are doing. We view the plantation of coffee as just one part of an entire ecosystem,” Montanari says. “I like to say our business here isn’t producing coffee. It’s a factory of photosynthesis.” Montanari may have pioneered regenerative agriculture in the region, but he is no longer alone. His farm is one of 68 in the Cerrado Coffee Farmers Cooperative (Expocaccer), centred around the town of Patrocínio, that have been certified as regenerative by Regenagri, a global organisation that aims to guarantee the health and preservation of the soil, and certified by Control Union UK. Last year Italian coffee brand Illycaffe received full Chain of Custody certification from Regenagri for its Brazilian coffee, and launched a Cerrado Mineiro Regenerative Agriculture coffee product globally. But it is Nespresso that Montanari has been working with longest and most closely, first through the company’s triple A sustainable sourcing programme, and since 2020 on its pledge to go beyond triple A and convert 95% of the 150,000 farms it sources from to regenerative practices by 2030.   is also working to convert its entire coffee supply chain to regenerative agriculture, but over a longer time frame. Nestle is doing so in partnership with Rainforest Alliance, which, in the absence of a universally agreed definition, defines regenerative agriculture as a series of practices that promote soil health, conserve biodiversity, restore ecosystems and improve livelihoods. The international NGO has created a   for coffee to certify suppliers, who move through three different levels of bronze, silver and gold. Last year, even bronze-level activities such as more targeted fertiliser use and cover crops resulted in a 5% to 25% increase in coffee productivity per hectare, and 15%-30% lower greenhouse gas emissions across the countries that Nestle sources from,  . The next day we met another of Nespresso’s gold-level suppliers near Patrocinio: Paula Curiacos Urtado and Marcelo Cocco Urtado of Fazenda Tres Meninas, a 54-hectare coffee farm, which the couple bought in 2016. Marcelo, who has a master’s degree in environmental technology and is from a four-generation coffee family, and Paula, a zoo technician, decided to buy Tres Meninas after an unsuccessful effort to introduce more regenerative techniques on the farm owned by Marcelo’s family. “Here we could do what we believed we needed to do” to rescue the soil, which was depleted from years of high dependency on chemical inputs, Marcelo said. The Urtados decided to use 100% natural methods to nourish the soil and fight the pests and fungal diseases that can blight coffee crops – a step beyond even Rainforest Alliance’s gold level, where limited chemical inputs are allowed. They are also renewably powered, with a large solar power installation. Our visit was shortly after the coffee cherries had been harvested, and cover crops grew chest-high between the serried rows. On a tour of the farm, Marcelo explained how they use a mixture of five or six cover crops, because they each bring different benefits to the soil. “Some plants fix nitrogen to the soil, others bring potassium from the soil to the surface,” he said. Others attract insects that are natural predators to the pests that feed on coffee plants. Cover crops also protect plants from overheating during the summer and from frost in winter, shielding them in 2022, when both evils hit Brazilian coffee farmers hard during the same growing season. He illustrated the point by showing a temperature reading of soil on one of the farm’s dirt roads. At 42 degrees Celsius the reading was 15C higher than the 27C from the ground between the planted rows. Marcelo explained that native shrubs and trees interspersed between the coffee rows are at different levels of canopy, to break the wind and prevent the spread of fungi and diseases. Sets of bee houses are also placed every 4 hectares, to do the crucial work of pollinating the coffee bushes when they flower and, Paula maintains, imparting a lovely flavour. One big barrier the couple had to overcome was how could they mechanically extract weeds – necessary if they weren’t using herbicides – and also harvest the ripe coffee cherries without damaging the cover crops. But this was solved with a little engineering ingenuity: Marcelo showed us the farm machinery he had doctored to push the cover crops temporarily aside, allowing them to spring back once the machine has passed. Like Montanari’s farm, Tres Minenas is a living laboratory: from the beginning the couple has disseminated data with universities and welcomed students and other farmers to visit and learn from them. Such farmer advocacy is critical if regenerative agriculture is going to scale, says Julie Dubost de Ferron, global head of Nespresso’s corporate communications. In Brazil, Nespresso employs 24 agronomists, who supply farmers with training, along with native trees for agroforestry and new coffee varieties that have been bred to be more resistant to disease and drought. But it takes more than that to convince ageing and conservative-minded farmers, who like Montanari’s family, have been farming the same land for generations, to abandon age-old practices, she says. “In Colombia, farmers grow up thinking you have to have a ‘clean farm’, taking everything else out of the soil because it competes with the coffee crop (for nutrients),” De Ferron says. “There’s a lot of training (needed) to explain that some plants help the coffee; they don’t compete with it. So agronomists are important, but what works best is having another farmer share (their) experience.” Paula hears a litany of concerns from the farmers she speaks to. She says one farmer may visit a larger regenerative farm, such as Montanari’s, and say the method is only suitable for big, profitable farms. Others might come to Tres Meninas and think it is too small, and such practices can’t be scaled up. But, she said, “It’s not about the size (of the farm). It’s about the mindset (of the farmer). It is scalable, for everybody. They just need to adapt it to their situation.” The biggest change in mindset has been to let go of the idea that farmers should maximise their coffee-planting area, says Cecilia Seravalli Soares, head of sustainability marketing at Nestle Brazil. While increasing productivity was the goal of the triple A programme, she says, regenerative agriculture is about planting fewer, higher-yielding coffee plants to make room for greater plant diversity on a farm. “We tell them, you don’t have to produce so much coffee, planting in every area of the farm, but what you do plant has to be more profitable,” she says. “Regenerative helps the farmers to earn more money, and reduce the cost of running the farm, over the long term.” Paula said that for the first five years, as they were getting established, the cost of production was about 20% higher than conventional farms. “Now, we have the same cost of production, but we are much more resilient,” she says. Their yields, of about 50 bags per hectare, are much higher than the Brazilian average. And they are able to sell it at higher prices to Expocaccer and Nespresso. Montanari's farm and Tres Meninas were among the first five farms to be certified by Regenagri when it started three years ago. But a small yet growing number of Brazilian coffee farmers are also doing the maths. Franco Costantini, CEO and founder of Regenagri, says coffee grew on 45,335 hectares of land certified by Regenagri in Brazil in 2023 – three times the uptake in 2022. Still, the 20% drop in income the Urtados experienced during the transition period is no something that is affordable to the  who depend on the coffee industry for their livelihoods, 70% of them smallholders farming less than five hectares of land. De Ferron says that in countries like Colombia there is additional help with crop insurance, microfinance and provision of pensions, so older farmers can afford to retire. And in Indonesia, Nestle recently launched a weather insurance programme, in partnership with climate insurance specialist Blue Marble, that will insure 800 smallholder coffee farmers for unpredictable weather patterns, such as rainfall and drought, using satellite-based climate data. “The future of coffee is in danger. We strongly believe that regenerative agriculture is how we protect it,” says De Ferron. “But it’s not a small thing for us, or for the coffee industry as a whole. And it definitely isn’t a small thing for the coffee farmers. It’s risky because even if you have a more diversified income (from agroforestry), you still have to get your income from coffee.” But what of the prospect of coffee farmers being able to generate an additional income for the CO2 they have mitigated through carbon markets? Paula says there will need to be further development in measurement protocols, including to ensure that a farm like theirs is rewarded for the huge gains they made before entering Regenagri’s programme. According to  , coffee grown on its certified farms in Brazil showed a reduction of 1.99 tonnes of CO2 equivalent per tonne of coffee, taking into account lower greenhouse gas emissions, primarily from reduced chemical usage, and higher biomass sequestration, compared with conventionally produced coffee. Average water reduction per tonne of coffee was 43,368 litres. In May it launched a new insetting standard that companies such as Illycaffe and Nestle will be able to use to make quantifiable claims in sustainability reports that they are reducing the climate impacts in their supply chains. It could also be the basis for an insetting credit market, which is being considered by the Greenhouse Gas Protocol. ( ) “Scale is coming because of the value of the programme for the whole supply chain,” says Regenagri’s Costantini. But like the offsetting market, which has been rocked by credibility issues, insetting carries risks of double counting and lack of permanence if a natural disaster struck a farm, for example, washing away soil or if land use changed , he says. So there will need to be strong standards and a strict mechanism to ensure no misuse of invalid claims. The key problem, though, is that finance from both insetting and offsetting markets could only come a few years down the track. As Santiago Gowland, CEO of Rainforest Alliance, points out, what farmers need is upfront finance, such as low-interest loans. He talks about  , a Vietnamese coffee farmer, who struggled financially for the first couple of years as he experimented with getting the right mix of intercropped plants, such as durian and macadamia trees, alongside his coffee plants, but by year three saw a 25% decrease in costs from fewer chemical inputs, and an increase of 35% in profits, from being able to sell his coffee for higher prices. Together with the additional income from durian and macadamia, he is today earning about 40% more than his neighbours. Gowland says one way Rainforest Alliance is looking to try to help bridge that gap is through innovative partnerships, as it recently struck with  , which aims to raise 350 million euros to bring finance solutions to farmers enrolled in its regenerative agriculture programs in Africa, Latin America and Asia. Still, it is a fraction of the U.N.’s   that will need to be invested in nature-based solutions by 2030, a tripling of existing finance. But with coffee such an important export crop for countries such as Brazil, Colombia and Vietnam, Gowland thinks the sector is ripe for blended finance vehicles, where governments and multilateral agencies put in finance to de-risk private sector investment. “When there’s money to unlock, it’s easier to align the finances.” For Montanari, whose daughter is at university studying agronomy, and the Urtados, who have two daughters, what motivates them is the hope that they are still in business, with their children, farming coffee in the next 20 years."

Putin's commodities ban threat puzzles Russian firms and officials,"['markets', 'europe', '']",", Gleb Bryanski, ,  , Darya Korsunskaya,   , Gleb Stolyarov","Reporting by Gleb Bryanski, Dasha Korsunskaya, Gleb Stolyarov; writing by Gleb Bryanski; editing by Guy Faulconbridge and Kevin Liffey","MOSCOW, Sept 12 (Reuters) - Russian officials and managers are perplexed by President Vladimir Putin's   to limit exports of strategic commodities in response to Western sanctions, and wonder if it can be realised without hurting Russia more than the West. Putin made the suggestion 23 minutes into a routine government meeting on Wednesday, asking Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin to come up with some ideas that would not harm Russia's interests. Yet many of Russia's commodities such as oil, gas, nickel, titanium, gold and diamonds are already subject to various levels of voluntary or mandatory import restrictions or even bans imposed by the West itself. Russian government officials and company executives were caught off guard. ""Everyone is in a state of shock,"" said a source in one of the affected companies, who spoke on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of appearing to criticise the president. ""This initiative came really out of the blue."" Another company source said: ""It's like shooting yourself in the foot."" Cutting exports of uranium, nickel and titanium - which Putin mentioned explicitly - would cut the foreign currency earnings of Russia's biggest firms including state-owned industrial conglomerate Rostec, state nuclear monopoly Rosatom and Nornickel, the world's top producer of refined nickel. Together, they employ about a million people, and their revenues have already been affected by Western sanctions. Nornickel's   first-half profit fell by 22% as it tries to pivot its exports to Asia. It has described the combination of low nickel prices and Western sanctions as a ""perfect storm"". The global market price of nickel did blip upwards on Putin's comments - but the current wealth of supply means it is far below historic highs. A Russian government source, who also spoke on condition of anonymity, said any ban should spare so-called ""friendly"" countries including China, Russia's major trading partner. The source stressed that it would take some time for the government to develop the plan - and that an order from the president to do so had yet to reach the government. Another source close to the government added that Putin had ""asked for a plan to be worked out, not implemented"". Major Russian commodities producers declined to comment. Russia and the West are entering   over the Ukraine war and Russia is pondering ways to respond to what it says is almost certain Western approval for Ukraine to strike deep into Russia using Western weapons. Putin said that if Russia went ahead, the measure would not be limited to uranium, nickel and titanium. He noted that Russia has 22% of the world's natural gas reserves, 23% of gold reserves, and 55% of global diamond reserves. Uranium may be the one commodity where restrictions could genuinely hurt the West. Russia accounted for 27% of the enriched uranium supplied to U.S. commercial nuclear reactors last year. While the U.S. has in theory banned imports of the fuel from Russia, it also provided for waivers through 2027 as it expands its own enrichment facilities. Yet Europe has largely weaned itself off the Russian gas it used to depend on. Group of Seven and European Union bans on imports of Russian-origin diamonds forced Moscow to buy up diamonds from its sanctions-hit producer, Alrosa  . And all Russia's major gold producers are already under Western sanctions. Meanwhile, Russia's largest titanium sponge maker VSMPO-AVISMA, partly owned by Rostec, has been struggling to find replacements for supplies of titanium concentrate from Ukraine, with which Russia is at war. Putin himself emphasised that restrictions would not happen ""tomorrow"", and that they must not harm Russia's interests. On Friday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov stressed the as-yet hypothetical nature of the idea. ""There are no specifics yet, it was a proposal to think about it without harming ourselves, without damaging our own interests,"" he said. ""They (the government) will consider it."""
"India's trade deficit widens in August on spike in gold imports, weak exports","['world', 'india', '']",", Shivangi Acharya,   , Manoj Kumar","Reporting by Shivangi Acharya; Additional reporting by Rajendra Jadhav in MUMBAI; Editing by Nivedita Bhattacharjee, Alexandra Hudson","NEW DELHI, Sept 17 (Reuters) - India's merchandise trade deficit in August widened to a ten-month high of $29.65 billion after gold imports surged while exports fell, dragged down by climbing shipping costs and sluggish global demand. Economists had expected the country's August trade deficit to be $23 billion, according to a Reuters poll. The deficit stood at $23.5 billion in the previous month. ""Exports are facing huge challenges on current global circumstances,"" Trade Secretary Sunil Barthwal told reporters, in regard to the monthly trade data. Rising shipping costs and a slowdown in China coupled with recessionary trends in Europe and the US were also impacting exports, he said. Outbound shipments from the world's fifth-largest economy fell 9.3% year-on-year, for the second month in a row, to $34.71 billion last month, data showed, while imports increased by 3.3% to $64.36 billion. Monthly gold imports in August surged more than three times to $10.06 billion compared to the previous month, partly due to an increase in domestic demand, a senior commerce ministry official said. In value terms, August gold imports were the highest since March 2021, when they had touched $8.5 billion, according to Reuters calculations. Gold imports through official channels have also gone up after a cut in the import tariff to 6% from 15% in the budget in July, discouraging gold smuggling, the official said. Services exports in August were estimated at $30.69 billion, and imports at $15.70 billion, compared with $28.71 billion and $15.09 billion, respectively, a year ago. India's total goods and services exports for the fiscal year 2023/24, which ended in March, stood at nearly $776 billion while imports for the same period were nearly $855 billion. Exporters said Indian goods exports have been impacted by the escalating US-China trade war and rising freight costs, besides a fall in global commodity prices. ""Freight costs for Indian exporters' shipping goods to Europe and the U.S. have more than doubled in the past year, driven by disruptions in the Red Sea,"" said Ajay Srivastava, founder of the Delhi-based think tank Global Trade Research Initiative. The think-tank has urged the government to take steps to strengthen domestic shipping lines and container production, noting that over 90% of India's merchandise exports were dependent on global carriers like Maersk [RIC:RIC:APMOLM.UL], MSC and COSCO [RIC:RIC:COSCO.UL]. The  , in a report earlier this month, urged the Indian government to reduce import tariffs and integrate into global value chains to boost exports, noting the country's manufacturing firms had not fully seized opportunities from China's exit from these sectors. The trade secretary said the trade deficit was not a matter of concern for an emerging economy like India. ""There is a huge consumption demand coming from the economy, which is growing at double the rate of other countries,"" Barthwal said."

"Reports of dollar's demise are greatly exaggerated, JPMorgan says","['markets', 'us', '']",", Marc Jones","Reporting by Marc Jones
Editing by Christina Fincher","LONDON, Sept 4 (Reuters) - Suggestions that the dollar's dominance of the global financial system is ending are wide of the mark, JPMorgan said on Wednesday, despite some dramatic signs of change in commodity markets and certain trading blocs. China's rise and the use of economic sanctions on the likes of Russia mean there is a trend of diversification away from the dollar, JPMorgan said, but reasons for the U.S. currency's dominance remain ""well-entrenched and structural in nature"". It pointed to the rising amounts of dollar-denominated bank deposits in emerging markets, sovereign wealth fund behaviour and non-reserve foreign assets, saying it ""more than offset"" the dollar's secular decline in overall emerging market FX reserve holdings. The dollar's share in total world liabilities is still on the rise too thanks to record amounts of debt issuance and even talk of de-dollarization in China appeared ""exaggerated"" despite geopolitical rivalry. ""Meaningful erosion of dollar dominance is likely to take decades, and the decline in the dollar's share of global trade and overall FX reserve holdings should not be confused with de-dollarization,"" the investment bank's report said. Areas where significant changes are happening include commodities markets where oil trading is increasingly done in non-USD currencies and demand from central banks and emerging market consumers for gold has boomed. The most ""underappreciated risk to USD hegemony"" was a possible fragmentation of the international payments system where the dollar has long been all powerful, the bank argued. China and India are the global leaders in terms of e-commerce innovation and activity whereas the U.S. and Western Europe's share is now less than 30%. Washington's use of tough financial sanctions means Russia, China and other countries are building alternatives to the SWIFT bank-to-bank system. Dozens of central banks are piloting new digital versions of their national currencies that could also make avoiding the U.S. banking system easier. ""The genuine confidence of the private sector in the dollar as a store of value seems uncontested,"" JPMorgan's report said. ""However, we are witnessing greater diversification and important shifts in cross-border transactions as a result of sanctions against Russia, China’s efforts to bolster usage of the renminbi, and geoeconomic fragmentation."""

Exclusive: Russia payment hurdles with China partners intensified in August,"['business', 'finance', '']",", Reuters",Reporting by Reuters in Moscow; Editing by Elisa Martinuzzi and Susan Fenton,"MOSCOW, Aug 30 (Reuters) - Some Russian companies are facing growing delays and rising costs on payments with trading partners in China, leaving transactions worth tens of billions of yuan in limbo, Russian sources with direct knowledge of the issue told Reuters. Russian companies and   for a few months have pointed to delays in transactions after Chinese banks tightened compliance following   of secondary sanctions for dealing with Russia. The sources said the problem has intensified this month. Chinese state banks are shutting down transactions with Russia ""en masse"" and billions of yuan worth of payments are held up, a source close to the government, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told Reuters. China is Russia's largest trading partner, accounting for a third of Russia's foreign trade last year and supplying items such as vital industrial equipment and consumer goods that help Russia weather Western sanctions. It also provides a lucrative market for many Russian exports that China relies on, from oil and gas to agricultural products. After the U.S. Treasury in June   secondary sanctions on banks in China and other countries for dealing with Russia, Chinese banks started to take a very strict stance on transactions, said a source at one of Russia's leading e-commerce platforms. It sells a wide variety of consumer goods imported from China. ""At that moment, all cross-border payments to China stopped. We found solutions, but it took about three weeks, which is a very long time, trade volumes fell drastically during that time,"" said the source. One working solution was to buy gold, move it to Hong Kong and sell it there, depositing cash in a local bank account, the person said. Sources told Reuters that some Russian businesses have been using chains of intermediaries in third countries to handle their transactions and get around compliance checks run by Chinese banks. As a result, costs to process transactions have risen to as much as 6% of transaction payments, from close to zero before, they said. The sources spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter. ""For many small companies, this means a complete shutdown,"" another source close to the government said. The Kremlin acknowledged the problem but said that economic cooperation is important for both countries and that solutions will be found. ""With such volumes and in such an unfriendly environment, it is impossible to avoid some problematic situations,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said in a statement to Reuters. ""However, the truly partnership spirit of our relations allows us to discuss and resolve current issues constructively,"" he said. Transactions with China are not of grave concern to top Russian leadership, however, because payments in priority areas are still proceeding smoothly, and there is political will from both sides, a banking source told Reuters.Bilateral arrangements for large companies, such as Russia's commodity exporters and China's exporters of vital technologies, still work well, whereas smaller companies trading in consumer goods experience problems, sources said. Russian exporters haven't experienced difficulties in receiving payments for commodities that China imports, such as oil or grain, another source close to the Russian government told Reuters. Bilateral trade between Russia and China grew by 1.6% to $137 billion in the first half of 2024, according to China's official customs data, after hitting a record high $240 billion in 2023. ""Normal trade between China and Russia is consistent with WTO rules and market principles, is not directed against third parties and is not subject to interference or coercion by third parties,"" a Chinese foreign ministry spokesman told Reuters. ""We firmly oppose any illegal unilateral sanctions and ""long-arm jurisdiction"" and will take all necessary measures to safeguard our legitimate rights and interests,"" the spokesman added. Russia's imports from China fell by more than 1% to $62 billion in January-July 2024 due to payment problems, according to China's official statistics. Russia's central bank forecasts the country's total imports from around the world will fall by as much as 3% this year. ""Imports will decrease in 2024 due to the strengthening of sanctions barriers related to payments and logistics,"" the central bank said, although it predicted that the situation would improve in the medium term, according to draft monetary policy guidelines published on Aug. 29.After Russian President Vladimir Putin's visit to China in May, some   without a global business stepped in to handle bilateral payments. They would be out of the reach of Western sanctions enforcers. However, sources pointed out that these banks often had outdated IT systems and lacked staff with the necessary skills. The banking source said that cross-border couriers were shuttling transfer papers across the Russia-China border to get them physically stamped and signed by Chinese bankers. ""Until issues with payments are resolved at the state level, we cannot expect a dynamic inflow of investments from China,"" said Kirill Babaev, head of the China Institute at the Russian Academy of Sciences. Research co-authored by Babaev and released this month highlights the risks posed to Russia's industrial sector where China has become a leading supplier. ""In today's situation, payment problems with Chinese banks particularly exacerbate this challenge, as there are no other major suppliers of many types of industrial equipment besides China at present,"" the research paper said. Large companies in China as well as India are heavily dependent on American and European markets, Dmitry Birichevski, head of the economic department at Russia's foreign ministry, said at a conference in Moscow on Aug. 16. ""And they are being told, 'Guys, if you continue to work with Russia, we will cut off your access to our market and choke off your oxygen supply',"" he said."

Cryptoverse: Trump's bitcoin stockpile plan stirs debate,"['technology', '']",", Medha Singh,   , Lisa Pauline Mattackal",Reporting by Lisa Mattackal and Medha Singh in Bengaluru; Graphic by Sumanta Sen; Editing by Pravin Char,"Aug 6 (Reuters) - (This Aug. 6 story has been refiled to correct to 'Rahul,' not 'Raoul,' in paragraph 19) ""Never sell your bitcoin,"" Donald Trump told a cheering crowd at a crypto convention in Nashville, Tennessee in late July. The Republican presidential candidate's   was the latest overture in his effort to court crypto-focused voters ahead of November's election and offered a bevy of campaign promises, including a plan for a state bitcoin reserve. ""If elected, it will be the policy of my administration to keep 100% of all the bitcoin the U.S. government currently holds or acquires into the future,"" Trump said, adding the funds would serve as the ""core of the strategic national bitcoin stockpile."" Indeed, Trump isn't the only one with such a proposal. U.S. Senator   has introduced legislation that would see the U.S. government purchase one million bitcoin, around 5% of total supply, while independent candidate Robert F Kennedy Jr has suggested a government stockpile of four million bitcoin. A strategic reserve would be one use for the massive amount of bitcoin held by the U.S. government. The jury's out on what it would be used for, whether it's feasible, or if it's even welcome for the broader crypto market, though. The U.S. government holds a bumper cache of crypto: around $11.1 billion worth which includes 203,239 bitcoin tokens, according to data firm Arkham Intelligence which said the pile came from criminal seizures, including from online marketplace Silk Road, which was shut down in 2013. At current levels, the U.S. holds about 1% of overall global bitcoin supply - which stands at about 19.7 million tokens, according to Blockchain.com. Bitcoin's total supply is capped at 21 million coins. To compare against big non-state investors, Michael Saylor's Microstrategy   holds about 226,500 bitcoin tokens, as per second-quarter results. BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust   and Grayscale Bitcoin Trust   hold 344,070 and 240,140 tokens respectively, according to data site BitcoinTreasuries. A government bitcoin stockpile could shore up bitcoin's price. ""It would have a positive impact on price. It would have to because we've never had such a limited supply commodity, albeit digital, assume a new state of a reserve asset,"" said Mark Connors, head of global macro at Onramp Bitcoin. Yet such a reserve also means fewer tokens for crypto investors to trade with and could leave them exposed if the government ever sold part of its reserves. ""RFK talked about having 19% of bitcoin, the same amount of the gold supply - I can't imagine a single bitcoiner would be happy about that,"" Connors added. Governments besides the United States also boast bumper hoards of bitcoin, with BitcoinTreasuries reporting China is the second largest government holder, with 190,000 coins. While the prospect of a national bitcoin reserve is uncertain, crypto watchers are nonetheless pondering what form it could take. Connors suggested the Federal Reserve could manage the reserves for the Treasury Department, as it does with gold. On the other hand, the stockpile could be more akin to the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, where both the president and Congress have varying amounts of control, according to Frank Kelly, senior political strategist at asset manager DWS Group. ""There's a lot to parse and figure out there,"" Kelly said. There's also an irony that jars with many true bitcoin believers: the digital asset intended to be decentralized and free of government control becoming part of a state reserve. Regardless of what happens with a bitcoin stockpile, many market players are happy enough to see crypto becoming a significant campaign talking point. ""There's a general view in the industry that both parties are paying much more attention to digital assets,"" said Rahul Mewawalla, CEO of Mawson Infrastructure Group   which operates data centers for bitcoin mining. ""The expectation is that will continue post November."""

Gold's run to record high may crimp demand,"['markets', 'commodities', '']",", Clyde Russell",Editing by Sonali Paul,"LAUNCESTON, Australia, Aug 5 (Reuters) - Gold has been the standout commodity performer so far this year, gaining 18.5% and posting a record high. But the precious metal may become a victim of its own success, with consumer buying at risk from the surge in prices. Spot gold ended at $2,443.29 an ounce on Aug. 2, and it has largely held onto the gains made this year, which saw a sustained rally to an all-time high of $2,483.60 on July 17. The World Gold Council released its quarterly report last week and the industry group reported total demand of 1,258.2 metric tons in the second quarter, the highest on record for a second quarter and some 4% above the same period in 2023. But the breakdown of the demand figures shows some trends that may point to a slowdown in coming quarters. The biggest gain in demand was from what the Council called the Over The Counter (OTC) market, which largely means buying from institutional investors, high net-worth individuals and family offices. OTC demand was 329.2 tons in the second quarter, up 53% from the same quarter in 2023 and a massive jump of 385% from the first quarter. The Council attributed the surge in OTC appetite to ""portfolio diversification,"" which leads to the question as to how sustainable this demand is, given that once these investors have reached the point where they feel they have sufficient gold in their asset mix, they will likely ease back on purchases. The report also showed a strong decline in jewellery consumption, which dropped to 390.6 tons in the second quarter, down 19% from the same period in 2023. Joining jewellery in the losing column was official coins, where demand dropped 38% to 52.7 tons in the second quarter. Both of these signal that consumers may be starting to pull back on purchases because of the strong gain in prices. Of particular concern is jewellery demand in China and India, the two largest buyers of physical gold, which together account for almost half the market. China saw jewellery demand slump 35% in the second quarter to 86.3 tons, while India recorded a 17% fall to 106.5 tons, according to the Council report. A further sign that China's appetite for gold may be waning somewhat was the 18% drop in net imports via Hong Kong in June, with official data showing imports of 21.92 tons, down from 26.72 tons in May. China doesn't disclose gold import volumes, making the Hong Kong data a key proxy for demand in the world's top consumer. India's consumer demand is likely to get a boost in the current quarter after the government cut the   to 6% from 15%, but this is also likely to prove to be a one-time sugar hit to demand, rather than a sustainable shift to higher demand. Higher prices also likely weighed on flows into Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs), with the Council figures showing a net drop of 7.2 tons in the second quarter, which followed a decline of 113 tons in the first. Central bank buying also eased in the second quarter, coming in at 183.4 tons, down from the 299.9 tons in the first, although up 6% from the 173.6 tons in the second quarter of 2023. Overall, there are enough factors to suggest that the rise to a record high for gold is starting to crimp some of the more price-sensitive demand. But it's not all bad news, with investor interest likely to be maintained by the ongoing expectation that monetary policy in several key countries is likely to be eased, with a particular focus on likely interest rate cuts by the U.S. Federal Reserve. High geopolitical tensions, with ongoing conflict in the Middle East and Ukraine, as well as political risk surrounding what is shaping to be a tight U.S. presidential election are also likely to keep interest in gold high. The combination of bearish and bullish factors for the yellow metal may end up having the effect of keeping the price in a relatively narrow range for the rest of the year.

Golden rule: Why younger investors are drawn to gold,"['markets', 'wealth', '']",", Chris Taylor",Editing by Lauren Young,"NEW YORK, July 18 (Reuters) - What asset class do millennials and Gen Z investors both want to own? Here is an answer you may not have guessed: Gold. Among wealthy investors under the age of 43, 45% own gold as a physical asset, and another 45% are interested in holding it, according to a recent study by Bank of America Private Bank. Those are far higher percentages than other age groups. Usually this demographic is not interested in assets like gold, cash or Treasuries, because they are considered to be ""boring,"" says Liz Young Thomas, head of investment strategy for digital financial services firm SoFi. ""As Treasury yields rise, cash is paying a high interest rate, and gold is rising along with it. We are seeing returns we normally don’t see in such a short period of time,"" Thomas says. ""Naturally, when assets have strong returns, younger audiences start to perk up.” This confirms another study by money managers State Street, which finds that millennials have the highest allocation to gold in their portfolios, at 17%, far outpacing both boomers and Gen X at 10%. So what is going on? Why are younger investors so intrigued by a somewhat stodgy asset that has been around for thousands of years? Part of gold’s renewed buzz is its healthy spot price, which as of this writing  . It is also increasingly on the shelves in popular retail environments, which boosts visibility. Big-box chain Costco started selling 1-oz gold bars last fall and has been doing a brisk trade of up to $200 million monthly, according to Wells Fargo estimates. Since younger investors’ interest has been piqued, what golden rules should they keep in mind? A few thoughts from the experts: Part of the appeal of gold is that it is tangible. If the world’s financial system happens to go haywire, or currencies collapse, at least you would have something real to hold onto. “I have found with my millennial clients that as they get wealthier, they are more interested in investing in directly-held, self-custodied gold,” says Eric Amzalag, a financial planner in Canoga Park, California, whose clients tend to use online precious metals retailer APMEX. That is because investment goals often shift from growth to capital preservation, Amzalag adds. With physical gold you have unique challenges like: finding a reputable dealer who won’t take advantage of you; getting it delivered and stored securely; insuring your purchase; And then figuring out how to eventually sell it, since Costco is not about to buy that gold bar back from you. To protect your portfolio, check out   from the World Gold Council. An exchange-traded fund – either backed by physical gold, or one that invests in gold futures – takes away the problems of buying, storing and selling. It also makes asset exposure relatively easy. “There are some fees associated with that, but ETFs are a nice alternative if you don’t want to actually take delivery of bullion and hold it in your basement,” says SoFi’s Thomas. The largest such ETF, SPDR Gold Shares ( ), carries an expense ratio of 0.4% and boasts one-year returns of more than 23%. A similar approach is to buy an ETF comprised of mining stocks, such as VanEck Gold Miners ( ), which includes the biggest names in the sector like Newmont Corp. and Barrick Gold. Gold can certainly serve a purpose in a portfolio, as an uncorrelated asset and a potential hedge against inflation or volatility. But, as a commodity, it can also be quite volatile and fall in and out of favor with investors. As such, equities should still be the main portfolio entrée for most investors, experts say. Companies that generate sales, earn profits, pay dividends and offer potential share-price appreciation make for a more dynamic asset class with superior long-term returns. As for gold, younger investors may keep it as a complementary side dish, says Jonathan Cameron, a financial planner in Miami. “We work with many young professionals, and we have been including a gold ETF (about 5%) in many of our clients’ portfolios as a hedge for several years,” Cameron says. “Everyone likes this decision.”"
"Exclusive: Traders face $1 billion loss on faltering Ghana cocoa supply, sources say","['markets', 'commodities', '']",", Maytaal Angel,   , Maxwell Akalaare Adombila","Reporting by Maytaal Angel in London, Maxwell Akalaari Adombile in Accra, and Ange Aboa in Abidjan; Editing by Dmitry Zhdannikov and Emelia Sithole-Matarise","LONDON/ACCRA, July 15 (Reuters) - Trading houses face losses of at least $1 billion on cocoa derivatives after major producer Ghana failed to deliver beans this year, forcing traders to liquidate short positions in a rallying market, six industry sources told Reuters. Global cocoa prices soared this year after bad weather, bean disease, smuggling and illegal gold mining reduced production and the volume of beans available in Ghana, the world's No.2 producer. Chocolate prices also rose globally and chocolate makers have reduced the size of products such as bars as a result of the huge cocoa price increase. Ghanaian authorities, who sell all of the country's beans, want to delay delivery of up to   this season - nearly half of the cocoa beans they sold - due to Ghana's devastated crop, five sources told Reuters last month. Ghana's cocoa regulator said the country was looking to roll over ""some volumes, but not in those quantities"". A delay of 350,000 tons means cocoa traders and processors could face losses of about $4,000 per ton on cocoa futures they had bought to hedge their physical bean purchases, or around $1.4 billion combined, the sources said. Trade houses like Cargill [RIC:RIC:CARG.UL], Olam   and Barry Callebaut   use the futures market to hedge or lock in a price for cocoa they have not yet sold on to chocolate makers. ""We're sitting staring at our screens, barely trading,"" said the head cocoa trader at a global trading house specialising in agricultural commodities, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorised to talk to the media. He said trading in the global cocoa physical and futures market has just about ground to a halt as a result of the deep losses and uncertainty. Much of Ghana's cocoa is bought by large, diversified trade houses with deep pockets, including Sucden, Olam, Barry Callebaut  , Cargill, Touton and Ecom. Traders typically sign deals to buy beans - like any other commodity - months in advance in the hope of reselling later at a profit. By doing so they take a so called long position in the physical market. As they wait for the physical commodity to be delivered for weeks or months they need to protect themselves against possible price falls. They typically do this by taking short positions in the futures market to protect against losses on a long position. Short trading bets on price falls so when the physical commodity arrives, long and short positions cancel each other out, guaranteeing a fixed price. The strategy unravels, however, if physical delivery - in this case cocoa beans - is delayed in a rallying market. If this happens, traders are forced to liquidate short positions for the month they had expected the commodity to arrive and take a new short position for the month of a new expected delivery. Doing so in April 2024 - after the market realised Ghana would delay bean delivery to 2025 - would have been costly, according to the traders. The six sources said last year traders who bought physical beans for May 2024 delivery would have taken equivalent short positions in May 2024 futures at around $3,000 a ton. With the market rallying in April 2024, those traders had to liquidate May 2024 shorts - or buy the futures back - at $11,000 a ton, facing losses of $8,000 a ton. As traders still hope to get the cocoa and need to protect themselves in the physical market, they had to take on new short positions for May 2025 delivery, which in April 2024 traded around $7,000 a ton. That means that if and when traders get their physical cocoa next May at $3,000 a ton, they will still face an aggregate loss of $4,000 per ton. The cocoa market is facing a third successive year of deficit and prices have roughly doubled this year. Traders will try to recoup at least some of their losses by charging chocolate makers like Hershey   and Mondelez   higher prices for products like cocoa powder and butter, said a top trader at a global agri-commodity trade house. Chocolate firms will likely struggle to pass on these costs to cash-strapped consumers who are already buying   in response to price rises. Market liquidity has also decreased because of exchanges asking traders to post more cash as collateral to cover their hedges, one of the traders said. This liquidity crunch has fuelled price fluctuations or volatility, he added. The collateral, known as a margin call, is set by the futures exchange as a down payment that covers a portion of the potential losses traders might face on their futures position. The higher the futures price, the higher the margin calls."

U.S. Treasury yields dropped across the board after   unexpectedly slipped 0.1% in June after being unchanged in May, while the annual increase was the smallest in a year, reinforcing views that inflation was abating. The report followed U.S. Federal Reserve Chair   to lawmakers on Capitol Hill that ""more good data"" would build the case for interest-rate cuts. ""The CPI print is the big macro driver today.

The interest-rate-sensitive small cap Russell 2000 index   rallied more than 3%.

The yen move was so steep that there was speculation about whether Japan had moved to shore up the currency, which fell last week to a 38-year low against the greenback. Japan's TV Asahi, citing government sources, reported that Japanese authorities had intervened. But the country's top currency diplomat Masato Kanda said he was not in position to comment on whether authorities had intervened, according to a Jiji Press report. The dollar index , which measures the greenback against a basket of currencies including the yen and the euro, fell 0.48% to 104.47. The euro was up 0.31% at $1.0864.

"Zimbabwe will stick to promises to build trust in new currency, central bank chief says","['markets', 'currencies', '']",", Nyasha Chingono","Reporting by Nyasha Chingono;
Editing by Kopano Gumbi, Alexander Winning and Mark Potter","HARARE, July 17 (Reuters) - Zimbabwe's government will stick to what it promised when it launched a new currency in April by ensuring it remains fully backed by reserves, the central bank governor told Reuters on Wednesday, adding that was the only way to build trust. The new currency, called Zimbabwe Gold or ZiG for short, is the southern African country's sixth attempt at a local currency in 15 years after a bout of hyperinflation under former leader Robert Mugabe. The last currency, the Zimdollar, fell 80% in the three months before it was scrapped, and authorities face an uphill battle to convince a sceptical population to stop transacting in foreign currencies. ""Confidence can only come with us walking the talk,"" Governor John Mushayavanhu said in an interview, referring to the central bank's commitment not to print money to finance government spending, which drove previous currency collapses. He said the government had a plan until 2030 to increase use of the ZiG and build up gold and foreign exchange reserves, which stood at $285 million when the currency was launched and now exceed $380 million. The ZiG is currently used in about 20% of local transactions, compared with 80% for foreign currencies. ""We want to gradually tilt that ratio to 70:30 by year-end or 60:40 thereafter, until we get to a situation where everybody is indifferent as to which currency they are using. This is the roadmap,"" Mushayavanhu said. Although the government says use of the ZiG is rising, there are widespread reports of shortages of the currency in shops. Mushayavanhu said enough ZiG notes had been printed to satisfy public demand and that the bank's reserve accumulation strategy could accelerate as commodity prices rise. The central bank has been converting royalties paid by mining companies into gold and is targeting 3 tons of gold in its reserves by year-end, up from 2.5 tons in April. Mushayavanhu said authorities expected inflation to end the year around 5%, versus an International Monetary Fund estimate of 7%. ""For the first time our numbers are almost aligned to those of the IMF,"" he said. ""Let's embrace our new currency and make it work."""
China's gold buying break seen as fleeting given its long-term needs,"['markets', 'commodities', '']",", Polina Devitt,   , Kevin Yao","Reporting by Polina Devitt in London, Kevin Yao in Beijing and Ashitha Shivaprasad in Bengaluru; Editing by Tony Munroe and Jamie Freed","LONDON/BEIJING, July 17 (Reuters) - China still has plenty of appetite for official gold purchases despite pausing in May and June, as its bullion holdings remain low as a share of reserves and geopolitical tensions persist, according to a policy insider, industry experts and data. Beijing's gold buying, which helped the spot price rally in April and May, is no longer perceived to be immune to price sensitivity, but ongoing geopolitical risks are expected to keep its longer-term programme to diversify exposure from U.S. dollar-denominated assets active. China's gold reserves need to rise in absolute and relative terms because they do not match the status of the world's second-largest economy and gold's share of its reserves is the lowest of any major economy, said a Chinese policy insider involved in internal discussions who declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter. ""But we need to look at prices - it's impossible for the central bank to maintain a constant amount of purchases each month,"" the insider said, adding that geopolitical factors spurred by the Russia-Ukraine war and the Middle East conflict were among drivers of China's gold demand in recent years. Officials at the central bank, the People's Bank of China (PBOC), have never publicly commented on what prompted a resumption in gold buying in November 2022 after a more-than three-year pause. Eight months after Western sanctions froze $300 billion of Russia's official reserves, about half of Moscow's total, the PBOC started reporting gold purchases and kept doing so for 18 months, forming a pillar for global gold prices to hit record highs in 2024. The PBOC was the world's largest single buyer of gold in 2023, with its net purchases of 7.23 million ounces the most by China for at least 46 years, according to the World Gold Council. But when it made no purchases in May and June this year, spot prices came under pressure, leaving the market guessing about China's future appetite. The policy insider attributed the pause in buying to ""high prices"". The spot price, which regained ground after a dip in June, hit a   during trading on Wednesday on improved U.S. rate cut hopes. The PBOC and foreign exchange regulator State Administration of Foreign Exchange did not respond to Reuters' requests for comment. China has the world's largest foreign currency reserves, at $3.22 trillion in June. But gold's share of China's overall reserves, which include its reserve position and special drawing rights (SDRs) at the International Monetary Fund, while at a record high of 4.9% is low compared to the global average of 16%. Developing and emerging market countries typically have a much lower share of gold in reserves than advanced economies, which have smaller currency reserves. ""Given that base and very large scale of FX reserves we believe the PBOC will be buying gold at higher volumes for decades,"" said Nitesh Shah, commodity strategist at WisdomTree. Demand from investors in China is also set to stay strong, he said, amid a prolonged property crisis and as central bank purchases give confidence in gold as a store of value. ""The official sector buying is a free advertisement for gold in China,"" said Shaokai Fan, global head of the central banks sector at the World Gold Council. ""In the sense that if the central bank is buying gold, maybe I, as a retail investor, shall buy some too."" Putting more reserves in gold is a matter of security because bullion can be stored onshore - safe from seizure. Officially, Russia's gold is 30% of its $597 billion reserves, but in terms of accessible assets the share is much bigger as half of Russia's reserves were frozen by Western countries in reaction to Moscow's invasion of Ukraine in 2022. That precedent, in which Russia's central bank kept access only to investments in yuan-denominated assets and gold, has served as a cautionary tale for China, which has an estimated 60% of its reserves in U.S. dollar-denominated assets, according to analysts. ""The main motivation of the PBOC is to be less dependent on the U.S. dollar and – in an extreme case – to be less susceptible to U.S. sanctions,"" said Carsten Menke, analyst at Julius Baer. He expects China's desire to diversify reserves to persist as ""the geopolitical tensions between China and the United States are unlikely to disappear anytime soon, independent of the outcome of the U.S. presidential elections."" It took China nine years to raise the share of gold in its total reserves to 4.9% from 1.8% in 2015. China holds 72.8 million ounces of gold worth about $170 billion. If it eventually lifted the share of gold in its reserves even to 10% at current reserve levels and prices, the purchases would total another $170 billion. For comparison, Russia's central bank stopped active buying of the precious metal in 2020 when gold reached 20% of its total reserves. Gold's share has since grown due in part to its rising price. The PBOC has sometimes reported past gold purchases well after they occurred, according to the World Gold Council, leading analysts to caution the latest statistics may not provide the full picture."

Fed's Powell defends central bank independence as challenges loom,"['business', 'finance', '']",", Michael S. Derby",Reporting by Michael S. Derby and Ann Saphir; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama and Andrea Ricci,"NEW YORK, July 9 (Reuters) - Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said on Tuesday central bank independence is a proven and politically popular way to achieve the best possible outcomes for the U.S. economy. “The record is pretty clear” that a central bank that operates outside of political factors and direction is “a good institutional arrangement that serves the public well,"" Powell said, adding ""as long as it's seen to serve the public well, it’s a good choice."" Powell's comments came during testimony on monetary policy and the economy given before the Senate's Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs. Powell flagged the ubiquity of independence at central banks among major economies, where the institutions are afforded latitude to achieve their respective mandates without being directed to do so by political authorities. A key aspect of independence is that it gives central banks space to make difficult choices when it comes to managing inflation. That bears on the near-term choices that now lie ahead for the Fed. With its short-term interest rate target at the highest level in decades, officials are searching for evidence that will allow them to cut rates as price pressures ease. That decision puts them potentially on track to ease just ahead of the presidential election in November, which would be highly contentious in political terms. Fed independence issues have loomed back into focus amid a presidential election season that could return Donald Trump to the White House. When Trump was president he repeatedly attacked the Fed for its monetary policy choices, breaking from decades of presidents steering clear from actively lobbying the Fed over how to set interest rate policy. Economists and other experts generally agree that political pressure on central banks leads to worse outcomes for the economy, especially on the inflation front. Powell told senators ""the results are clear"" that when a central bank can tackle its goals free of political direction ""you have better-anchored inflation expectations and you have better performance on inflation and better performance in the economy generally."" In his formal remarks Powell also noted that independence grants the Fed space to take a ""longer-term perspective"" on policy choices. Powell said that among elected officials, the benefit of Fed independence ""is pretty broadly understood and particularly on Capital Hill."" Senator Kevin Cramer, a Republican, told Powell he agreed. ""At least on Capitol Hill, we're all pretty much united"" on the importance of Fed independence, while acknowledging some moves within his own party to rein in Fed powers, something he said he had worked to counter. But he warned Powell on a pre-election rate cut, saying ""perception matters, and so I would just submit to you ...any move to lower interest rates or move interest rates either direction before November 5th could certainly be a bad perception."" The rising threat to Fed independence has driven the central bank to increasingly defend the value of the status in both public comments and in official communications. The central bank's   released last Friday included a section on the value of independence, for example. ""In an era of economic populism, and the possible advent of a second Trump administration, the idea of central bank independence is far more important than is commonly understood or appreciated among elected actors and the public,"" said Joseph Brusuelas, chief economist of consulting firm RSM US LLP. The issue of how Trump would approach Fed independence if returned to the presidency has been given additional urgency in the wake of what's called  , a Heritage Foundation organized effort created and overseen by a number of former Trump administration staffers. One of the views it espouses is that ""public opinion expressed through the lawmaking process in the Constitution should ultimately determine the monetary-institutional order in a free society."" The project calls for the Fed moving to an inflation-only legal mandate, dropping its directive to also promote strong job growth. It also supports curtailing the Fed's emergency lending powers and shrinking the Fed's   to levels seen in 2008 when the global financial crisis struck. Project 2025 even nods toward more radical changes including a possible shift to commodity-based money like gold or silver, and the possible abolition of the Fed itself. The report said at a ""minimum"" there should be a commission ""to explore the mission of the Federal Reserve, alternatives to the Federal Reserve system, and the nation’s financial regulatory apparatus."""
India inflation seen up in June due to soaring vegetable prices: Reuters poll,"['world', 'india', '']",", Vivek Mishra","Additional reporting by Anant Chandak; Polling by Susobhan Sarkar and Rahul Trivedi; Editing by Hari Kishan, Ross Finley and Tomasz Janowski","BENGALURU, July 9 (Reuters) - India consumer price inflation probably edged up in June, snapping five months of declines, largely because of a jump in vegetable prices caused by the damage to crops wrought by extreme weather, according to a Reuters poll of economists. Prices of tomatoes, onions, and potatoes - staples in every Indian kitchen - surged by double digits last month as extreme heat and   in   disrupted agricultural production. The July 5-9 Reuters poll of 54 economists forecast consumer price inflation   rose to 4.80% last month on a year earlier, up from 4.75% in May. Food accounts for around half the overall CPI basket. Forecasts for the data, due on July 12 at 1200 GMT, ranged from 4.10% to 5.19%. ""A sharp spike in vegetable prices along with cereals and pulses kept food inflation at higher levels and nullified the softness in eggs, fruits, and spices prices,"" said Kanika Pasricha, chief economic advisor at Union Bank of India. ""Core inflation likely stayed flat at all-time lows of 3.10% as gold prices eased somewhat during the month and commodity prices also remained under pressure."" Core inflation, which excludes volatile items, such as food and energy and is seen as a better gauge of domestic demand, was forecast to be 3.10% in June, according to the median estimate from a smaller sample of 19 economists. The Indian statistics agency does not publish core inflation data, but economists estimate the figure based on CPI data and some may publish their updated estimates after Friday's release. Many economists say despite the economy growing by more than 8%  , the recent decline in core inflation indicates overall weak domestic demand in an economy where private consumption accounts for nearly 60% of GDP. Some also said a   effective from this month is likely to exert upward pressure on inflation over the coming months, arresting a further fall in core CPI. ""Given the weight in the CPI basket (for telecoms) and past translation trends, this should push up headline CPI by another 20 bps or so, starting July,"" said Sajjid Chinoy, chief India economist at J.P.
