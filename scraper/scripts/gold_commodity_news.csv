Western ETF investors poised to heap fuel on gold's record rally,"['markets', '']",", Ashitha Shivaprasad",Reporting by Ashitha Shivaprasad in Bengaluru; Editing by Veronica Brown and Sharon Singleton,"Sept 24 (Reuters) - Inflows into gold exchange-traded funds, particularly from Western investors, are set to rise in coming months, adding yet more positive stimulus for already record high bullion prices, analysts said. Gold prices have surged some 27% so far this year to vault $2,600 per ounce, benefiting directly from looser central bank monetary policy and pockets of geo-political tension. Interest rate cutting cycles in the U.S., Europe and latterly China, have fanned bullish sentiment, with players focused on further gains including another record milestone of  . Exchange Traded Products (ETPs), or Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs), allow investors to   to assets like gold without taking delivery. Any rise in holdings is significant for prices, as ETPs are backed by the physical commodity. Increased inflows will reduce the supply of precious metal available in the market, bolstering prices further. ""Now that the rate cutting cycle has commenced, we think ETP inflows are likely to accelerate, supporting the next leg higher in gold,"" Standard Chartered analyst Suki Cooper said. ""ETP flows, which typically have a stronger correlation with real yields and the dollar, have turned positive. The bulk of the inflows have come from Europe, but over the past two months, North America has led fresh interest."" According to the   (WGC), global gold ETFs saw inflows of 28.5 tonnes, or $2.1 billion, in August with all regions reporting positive flows while western funds contributed the lion’s share. North America added inflows of 17.2 tonnes or $1.4 billion last month. Softer U.S. economic data, dovish Fed comments, declines in the dollar and yields, as well as lowering opportunity costs fueled inflows, the WGC added. This comes after gold ETFs had three straight years of outflows amid high global interest rates. The latest four months of inflows have only managed to trim the year-to-date losses to a net outflow of 44 metric tons. Last week, the Federal Reserve kicked off an anticipated series of   with a larger-than-usual half-percentage-point reduction. The   cut rates in June and also earlier this month.

Beijing's new measures include a planned 50 basis point cut to banks' reserve requirements. Major banks like J.P. Morgan, Goldman Sachs, Citi and UBS have reiterated their bullish stance on gold and forecast prices will move higher, with ETF holdings rising. ""Fed cuts are poised to bring Western capital back into gold ETFs, a component largely absent of the sharp gold rally observed in the last two years,"" Goldman Sachs said in a note. J.P. Morgan this week noted that retail-focused ETF builds will be key to a further sustained gold rally and projected prices to move towards a 2025 peak target of $2,850. Spot gold touched a record of $2,639.95 per ounce on Tuesday, driven by hopes of further monetary policy easing and  . Lower interest rates reduce the opportunity cost of holding the zero-yield bullion and it is considered a safe-asset amid turmoil.

"India's trade deficit widens in August on spike in gold imports, weak exports","['world', 'india', '']",", Shivangi Acharya,   , Manoj Kumar","Reporting by Shivangi Acharya; Additional reporting by Rajendra Jadhav in MUMBAI; Editing by Nivedita Bhattacharjee, Alexandra Hudson","NEW DELHI, Sept 17 (Reuters) - India's merchandise trade deficit in August widened to a ten-month high of $29.65 billion after gold imports surged while exports fell, dragged down by climbing shipping costs and sluggish global demand. Economists had expected the country's August trade deficit to be $23 billion, according to a Reuters poll. The deficit stood at $23.5 billion in the previous month. ""Exports are facing huge challenges on current global circumstances,"" Trade Secretary Sunil Barthwal told reporters, in regard to the monthly trade data. Rising shipping costs and a slowdown in China coupled with recessionary trends in Europe and the US were also impacting exports, he said. Outbound shipments from the world's fifth-largest economy fell 9.3% year-on-year, for the second month in a row, to $34.71 billion last month, data showed, while imports increased by 3.3% to $64.36 billion. Monthly gold imports in August surged more than three times to $10.06 billion compared to the previous month, partly due to an increase in domestic demand, a senior commerce ministry official said. In value terms, August gold imports were the highest since March 2021, when they had touched $8.5 billion, according to Reuters calculations. Gold imports through official channels have also gone up after a cut in the import tariff to 6% from 15% in the budget in July, discouraging gold smuggling, the official said. Services exports in August were estimated at $30.69 billion, and imports at $15.70 billion, compared with $28.71 billion and $15.09 billion, respectively, a year ago. India's total goods and services exports for the fiscal year 2023/24, which ended in March, stood at nearly $776 billion while imports for the same period were nearly $855 billion. Exporters said Indian goods exports have been impacted by the escalating US-China trade war and rising freight costs, besides a fall in global commodity prices. ""Freight costs for Indian exporters' shipping goods to Europe and the U.S. have more than doubled in the past year, driven by disruptions in the Red Sea,"" said Ajay Srivastava, founder of the Delhi-based think tank Global Trade Research Initiative. The think-tank has urged the government to take steps to strengthen domestic shipping lines and container production, noting that over 90% of India's merchandise exports were dependent on global carriers like Maersk [RIC:RIC:APMOLM.UL], MSC and COSCO [RIC:RIC:COSCO.UL]. The  , in a report earlier this month, urged the Indian government to reduce import tariffs and integrate into global value chains to boost exports, noting the country's manufacturing firms had not fully seized opportunities from China's exit from these sectors. The trade secretary said the trade deficit was not a matter of concern for an emerging economy like India. ""There is a huge consumption demand coming from the economy, which is growing at double the rate of other countries,"" Barthwal said."
The Brazilian farmers who are trying to keep the world in its coffee habit despite climate change,"['sustainability', '']",", Terry Slavin",Thomson Reuters,"September 16 - Marcelo Montanari likes to say he was born under a coffee tree. In the four generations that his family has farmed coffee in Brazil after emigrating from Italy 130 years ago, the Motanaris had to relocate four times, when farming became unviable for either political or climate reasons. The last move, to the Cerrado Mineiro region of Minas Gerais, was in 1975, when frost wiped out the crop in the state of Parana, then one of the country’s largest coffee-growing areas. It was an event felt by coffee lovers around the world as the price of their daily java doubled. Arabica coffee is second only to petroleum as the most valuable traded and consumed commodity worldwide. Unlike petroleum, however, there is no risk of flagging demand in the future, with burgeoning middle classes in Asia fast developing a coffee habit. In China, for example, coffee imports grew 30% in the first half of this year alone. And Montanari and his neighbours are at the heart of its production, with Brazil supplying almost half of the world’s demand, most of it from the Cerrado, a vast high savannah where coffee is harvested mechanically on plantations of up to 1,000 hectares – unlike the small plots where it is laboriously handpicked by smallholders in mountainous countries like Colombia. Yet the crop is everywhere under an   as climate change causes extreme weather events and rainfall becomes more erratic, playing havoc with yields. Areas suitable for coffee could  according to climate simulations, and arabica is most at risk, requiring temperatures between 18 degrees Celsius and 23C, and altitudes between 1,000 and 2,000 metres. That puts Cerrado Mineiro, where coffee is grown at altitudes of 900-1,250m, at the lower edge of viability, as I learned on a press trip with Nespresso to the region last September. But 44-year-old Montanari, who trained as an agronomist 20 years ago, is determined not to move again, and believes the key to bolstering the climate-resilience of his coffee crops is through regenerative agriculture. For the past 10 years he has worked to introduce regenerative methods on his 250-hectare farm, dramatically reducing the use of chemical fertilisers and pesticides by replacing them with biological alternatives and integrated pest management. Under , it’s mandatory for the country’s landowners to keep 20% of their property for natural vegetation, but on Montanari’s farm, it is nearly double that, at 36%. While coffee is grown in the full sun, rows of coffee plants are interspersed with native trees, including indigenous mahogany trees, which are commercially valuable, and give him a financial buffer. More importantly, the trees he has planted provide critically important resilience to the drought conditions that the region has been experiencing, Montanari says, with 30 days of water reserves in his ponds, far more than neighbours who are using traditional methods. “We take a holistic view with everything we are doing. We view the plantation of coffee as just one part of an entire ecosystem,” Montanari says. “I like to say our business here isn’t producing coffee. It’s a factory of photosynthesis.” Montanari may have pioneered regenerative agriculture in the region, but he is no longer alone. His farm is one of 68 in the Cerrado Coffee Farmers Cooperative (Expocaccer), centred around the town of Patrocínio, that have been certified as regenerative by Regenagri, a global organisation that aims to guarantee the health and preservation of the soil, and certified by Control Union UK. Last year Italian coffee brand Illycaffe received full Chain of Custody certification from Regenagri for its Brazilian coffee, and launched a Cerrado Mineiro Regenerative Agriculture coffee product globally. But it is Nespresso that Montanari has been working with longest and most closely, first through the company’s triple A sustainable sourcing programme, and since 2020 on its pledge to go beyond triple A and convert 95% of the 150,000 farms it sources from to regenerative practices by 2030.   is also working to convert its entire coffee supply chain to regenerative agriculture, but over a longer time frame. Nestle is doing so in partnership with Rainforest Alliance, which, in the absence of a universally agreed definition, defines regenerative agriculture as a series of practices that promote soil health, conserve biodiversity, restore ecosystems and improve livelihoods. The international NGO has created a   for coffee to certify suppliers, who move through three different levels of bronze, silver and gold. Last year, even bronze-level activities such as more targeted fertiliser use and cover crops resulted in a 5% to 25% increase in coffee productivity per hectare, and 15%-30% lower greenhouse gas emissions across the countries that Nestle sources from,  . The next day we met another of Nespresso’s gold-level suppliers near Patrocinio: Paula Curiacos Urtado and Marcelo Cocco Urtado of Fazenda Tres Meninas, a 54-hectare coffee farm, which the couple bought in 2016. Marcelo, who has a master’s degree in environmental technology and is from a four-generation coffee family, and Paula, a zoo technician, decided to buy Tres Meninas after an unsuccessful effort to introduce more regenerative techniques on the farm owned by Marcelo’s family. “Here we could do what we believed we needed to do” to rescue the soil, which was depleted from years of high dependency on chemical inputs, Marcelo said. The Urtados decided to use 100% natural methods to nourish the soil and fight the pests and fungal diseases that can blight coffee crops – a step beyond even Rainforest Alliance’s gold level, where limited chemical inputs are allowed. They are also renewably powered, with a large solar power installation. Our visit was shortly after the coffee cherries had been harvested, and cover crops grew chest-high between the serried rows. On a tour of the farm, Marcelo explained how they use a mixture of five or six cover crops, because they each bring different benefits to the soil. “Some plants fix nitrogen to the soil, others bring potassium from the soil to the surface,” he said. Others attract insects that are natural predators to the pests that feed on coffee plants. Cover crops also protect plants from overheating during the summer and from frost in winter, shielding them in 2022, when both evils hit Brazilian coffee farmers hard during the same growing season. He illustrated the point by showing a temperature reading of soil on one of the farm’s dirt roads. At 42 degrees Celsius the reading was 15C higher than the 27C from the ground between the planted rows. Marcelo explained that native shrubs and trees interspersed between the coffee rows are at different levels of canopy, to break the wind and prevent the spread of fungi and diseases. Sets of bee houses are also placed every 4 hectares, to do the crucial work of pollinating the coffee bushes when they flower and, Paula maintains, imparting a lovely flavour. One big barrier the couple had to overcome was how could they mechanically extract weeds – necessary if they weren’t using herbicides – and also harvest the ripe coffee cherries without damaging the cover crops. But this was solved with a little engineering ingenuity: Marcelo showed us the farm machinery he had doctored to push the cover crops temporarily aside, allowing them to spring back once the machine has passed. Like Montanari’s farm, Tres Minenas is a living laboratory: from the beginning the couple has disseminated data with universities and welcomed students and other farmers to visit and learn from them. Such farmer advocacy is critical if regenerative agriculture is going to scale, says Julie Dubost de Ferron, global head of Nespresso’s corporate communications. In Brazil, Nespresso employs 24 agronomists, who supply farmers with training, along with native trees for agroforestry and new coffee varieties that have been bred to be more resistant to disease and drought. But it takes more than that to convince ageing and conservative-minded farmers, who like Montanari’s family, have been farming the same land for generations, to abandon age-old practices, she says. “In Colombia, farmers grow up thinking you have to have a ‘clean farm’, taking everything else out of the soil because it competes with the coffee crop (for nutrients),” De Ferron says. “There’s a lot of training (needed) to explain that some plants help the coffee; they don’t compete with it. So agronomists are important, but what works best is having another farmer share (their) experience.” Paula hears a litany of concerns from the farmers she speaks to. She says one farmer may visit a larger regenerative farm, such as Montanari’s, and say the method is only suitable for big, profitable farms. Others might come to Tres Meninas and think it is too small, and such practices can’t be scaled up. But, she said, “It’s not about the size (of the farm). It’s about the mindset (of the farmer). It is scalable, for everybody. They just need to adapt it to their situation.” The biggest change in mindset has been to let go of the idea that farmers should maximise their coffee-planting area, says Cecilia Seravalli Soares, head of sustainability marketing at Nestle Brazil. While increasing productivity was the goal of the triple A programme, she says, regenerative agriculture is about planting fewer, higher-yielding coffee plants to make room for greater plant diversity on a farm. “We tell them, you don’t have to produce so much coffee, planting in every area of the farm, but what you do plant has to be more profitable,” she says. “Regenerative helps the farmers to earn more money, and reduce the cost of running the farm, over the long term.” Paula said that for the first five years, as they were getting established, the cost of production was about 20% higher than conventional farms. “Now, we have the same cost of production, but we are much more resilient,” she says. Their yields, of about 50 bags per hectare, are much higher than the Brazilian average. And they are able to sell it at higher prices to Expocaccer and Nespresso. Montanari's farm and Tres Meninas were among the first five farms to be certified by Regenagri when it started three years ago. But a small yet growing number of Brazilian coffee farmers are also doing the maths. Franco Costantini, CEO and founder of Regenagri, says coffee grew on 45,335 hectares of land certified by Regenagri in Brazil in 2023 – three times the uptake in 2022. Still, the 20% drop in income the Urtados experienced during the transition period is no something that is affordable to the  who depend on the coffee industry for their livelihoods, 70% of them smallholders farming less than five hectares of land. De Ferron says that in countries like Colombia there is additional help with crop insurance, microfinance and provision of pensions, so older farmers can afford to retire. And in Indonesia, Nestle recently launched a weather insurance programme, in partnership with climate insurance specialist Blue Marble, that will insure 800 smallholder coffee farmers for unpredictable weather patterns, such as rainfall and drought, using satellite-based climate data. “The future of coffee is in danger. We strongly believe that regenerative agriculture is how we protect it,” says De Ferron. “But it’s not a small thing for us, or for the coffee industry as a whole. And it definitely isn’t a small thing for the coffee farmers. It’s risky because even if you have a more diversified income (from agroforestry), you still have to get your income from coffee.” But what of the prospect of coffee farmers being able to generate an additional income for the CO2 they have mitigated through carbon markets? Paula says there will need to be further development in measurement protocols, including to ensure that a farm like theirs is rewarded for the huge gains they made before entering Regenagri’s programme. According to  , coffee grown on its certified farms in Brazil showed a reduction of 1.99 tonnes of CO2 equivalent per tonne of coffee, taking into account lower greenhouse gas emissions, primarily from reduced chemical usage, and higher biomass sequestration, compared with conventionally produced coffee. Average water reduction per tonne of coffee was 43,368 litres. In May it launched a new insetting standard that companies such as Illycaffe and Nestle will be able to use to make quantifiable claims in sustainability reports that they are reducing the climate impacts in their supply chains. It could also be the basis for an insetting credit market, which is being considered by the Greenhouse Gas Protocol. ( ) “Scale is coming because of the value of the programme for the whole supply chain,” says Regenagri’s Costantini. But like the offsetting market, which has been rocked by credibility issues, insetting carries risks of double counting and lack of permanence if a natural disaster struck a farm, for example, washing away soil or if land use changed , he says. So there will need to be strong standards and a strict mechanism to ensure no misuse of invalid claims. The key problem, though, is that finance from both insetting and offsetting markets could only come a few years down the track. As Santiago Gowland, CEO of Rainforest Alliance, points out, what farmers need is upfront finance, such as low-interest loans. He talks about  , a Vietnamese coffee farmer, who struggled financially for the first couple of years as he experimented with getting the right mix of intercropped plants, such as durian and macadamia trees, alongside his coffee plants, but by year three saw a 25% decrease in costs from fewer chemical inputs, and an increase of 35% in profits, from being able to sell his coffee for higher prices. Together with the additional income from durian and macadamia, he is today earning about 40% more than his neighbours. Gowland says one way Rainforest Alliance is looking to try to help bridge that gap is through innovative partnerships, as it recently struck with  , which aims to raise 350 million euros to bring finance solutions to farmers enrolled in its regenerative agriculture programs in Africa, Latin America and Asia. Still, it is a fraction of the U.N.’s   that will need to be invested in nature-based solutions by 2030, a tripling of existing finance. But with coffee such an important export crop for countries such as Brazil, Colombia and Vietnam, Gowland thinks the sector is ripe for blended finance vehicles, where governments and multilateral agencies put in finance to de-risk private sector investment. “When there’s money to unlock, it’s easier to align the finances.” For Montanari, whose daughter is at university studying agronomy, and the Urtados, who have two daughters, what motivates them is the hope that they are still in business, with their children, farming coffee in the next 20 years."

Putin's commodities ban threat puzzles Russian firms and officials,"['markets', 'europe', '']",", Gleb Bryanski, ,  , Darya Korsunskaya,   , Gleb Stolyarov","Reporting by Gleb Bryanski, Dasha Korsunskaya, Gleb Stolyarov; writing by Gleb Bryanski; editing by Guy Faulconbridge and Kevin Liffey","MOSCOW, Sept 12 (Reuters) - Russian officials and managers are perplexed by President Vladimir Putin's   to limit exports of strategic commodities in response to Western sanctions, and wonder if it can be realised without hurting Russia more than the West. Putin made the suggestion 23 minutes into a routine government meeting on Wednesday, asking Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin to come up with some ideas that would not harm Russia's interests. Yet many of Russia's commodities such as oil, gas, nickel, titanium, gold and diamonds are already subject to various levels of voluntary or mandatory import restrictions or even bans imposed by the West itself. Russian government officials and company executives were caught off guard. ""Everyone is in a state of shock,"" said a source in one of the affected companies, who spoke on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of appearing to criticise the president. ""This initiative came really out of the blue."" Another company source said: ""It's like shooting yourself in the foot."" Cutting exports of uranium, nickel and titanium - which Putin mentioned explicitly - would cut the foreign currency earnings of Russia's biggest firms including state-owned industrial conglomerate Rostec, state nuclear monopoly Rosatom and Nornickel, the world's top producer of refined nickel. Together, they employ about a million people, and their revenues have already been affected by Western sanctions. Nornickel's   first-half profit fell by 22% as it tries to pivot its exports to Asia. It has described the combination of low nickel prices and Western sanctions as a ""perfect storm"". The global market price of nickel did blip upwards on Putin's comments - but the current wealth of supply means it is far below historic highs. A Russian government source, who also spoke on condition of anonymity, said any ban should spare so-called ""friendly"" countries including China, Russia's major trading partner. The source stressed that it would take some time for the government to develop the plan - and that an order from the president to do so had yet to reach the government. Another source close to the government added that Putin had ""asked for a plan to be worked out, not implemented"". Major Russian commodities producers declined to comment. Russia and the West are entering   over the Ukraine war and Russia is pondering ways to respond to what it says is almost certain Western approval for Ukraine to strike deep into Russia using Western weapons. Putin said that if Russia went ahead, the measure would not be limited to uranium, nickel and titanium. He noted that Russia has 22% of the world's natural gas reserves, 23% of gold reserves, and 55% of global diamond reserves. Uranium may be the one commodity where restrictions could genuinely hurt the West. Russia accounted for 27% of the enriched uranium supplied to U.S. commercial nuclear reactors last year. While the U.S. has in theory banned imports of the fuel from Russia, it also provided for waivers through 2027 as it expands its own enrichment facilities. Yet Europe has largely weaned itself off the Russian gas it used to depend on. Group of Seven and European Union bans on imports of Russian-origin diamonds forced Moscow to buy up diamonds from its sanctions-hit producer, Alrosa  . And all Russia's major gold producers are already under Western sanctions. Meanwhile, Russia's largest titanium sponge maker VSMPO-AVISMA, partly owned by Rostec, has been struggling to find replacements for supplies of titanium concentrate from Ukraine, with which Russia is at war. Putin himself emphasised that restrictions would not happen ""tomorrow"", and that they must not harm Russia's interests. On Friday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov stressed the as-yet hypothetical nature of the idea. ""There are no specifics yet, it was a proposal to think about it without harming ourselves, without damaging our own interests,"" he said. ""They (the government) will consider it."""

""We have the U.S. elections, there's still a lot of uncertainty.""

Strong support also comes from China, which bought gold for its reserves for 18 consecutive months to April before suspending its program due to elevated prices. ""Chinese price sensitivity insures against hypothetical large price declines, which would likely reinvigorate Chinese buying,"" Thomas added. Further contributing to the upsurge in gold prices is that investors have been piling into physically-backed gold exchange traded funds (ETFs), which recorded net inflows last week of 8.5 metric tons, according to the World Gold Council (WGC).

Cryptoverse: Trump's bitcoin stockpile plan stirs debate,"['technology', '']",", Medha Singh,   , Lisa Pauline Mattackal",Reporting by Lisa Mattackal and Medha Singh in Bengaluru; Graphic by Sumanta Sen; Editing by Pravin Char,"Aug 6 (Reuters) - (This Aug. 6 story has been refiled to correct to 'Rahul,' not 'Raoul,' in paragraph 19) ""Never sell your bitcoin,"" Donald Trump told a cheering crowd at a crypto convention in Nashville, Tennessee in late July. The Republican presidential candidate's   was the latest overture in his effort to court crypto-focused voters ahead of November's election and offered a bevy of campaign promises, including a plan for a state bitcoin reserve. ""If elected, it will be the policy of my administration to keep 100% of all the bitcoin the U.S. government currently holds or acquires into the future,"" Trump said, adding the funds would serve as the ""core of the strategic national bitcoin stockpile."" Indeed, Trump isn't the only one with such a proposal. U.S. Senator   has introduced legislation that would see the U.S. government purchase one million bitcoin, around 5% of total supply, while independent candidate Robert F Kennedy Jr has suggested a government stockpile of four million bitcoin. A strategic reserve would be one use for the massive amount of bitcoin held by the U.S. government. The jury's out on what it would be used for, whether it's feasible, or if it's even welcome for the broader crypto market, though. The U.S. government holds a bumper cache of crypto: around $11.1 billion worth which includes 203,239 bitcoin tokens, according to data firm Arkham Intelligence which said the pile came from criminal seizures, including from online marketplace Silk Road, which was shut down in 2013. At current levels, the U.S. holds about 1% of overall global bitcoin supply - which stands at about 19.7 million tokens, according to Blockchain.com. Bitcoin's total supply is capped at 21 million coins. To compare against big non-state investors, Michael Saylor's Microstrategy   holds about 226,500 bitcoin tokens, as per second-quarter results. BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust   and Grayscale Bitcoin Trust   hold 344,070 and 240,140 tokens respectively, according to data site BitcoinTreasuries. A government bitcoin stockpile could shore up bitcoin's price. ""It would have a positive impact on price. It would have to because we've never had such a limited supply commodity, albeit digital, assume a new state of a reserve asset,"" said Mark Connors, head of global macro at Onramp Bitcoin. Yet such a reserve also means fewer tokens for crypto investors to trade with and could leave them exposed if the government ever sold part of its reserves. ""RFK talked about having 19% of bitcoin, the same amount of the gold supply - I can't imagine a single bitcoiner would be happy about that,"" Connors added. Governments besides the United States also boast bumper hoards of bitcoin, with BitcoinTreasuries reporting China is the second largest government holder, with 190,000 coins. While the prospect of a national bitcoin reserve is uncertain, crypto watchers are nonetheless pondering what form it could take. Connors suggested the Federal Reserve could manage the reserves for the Treasury Department, as it does with gold. On the other hand, the stockpile could be more akin to the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, where both the president and Congress have varying amounts of control, according to Frank Kelly, senior political strategist at asset manager DWS Group. ""There's a lot to parse and figure out there,"" Kelly said. There's also an irony that jars with many true bitcoin believers: the digital asset intended to be decentralized and free of government control becoming part of a state reserve. Regardless of what happens with a bitcoin stockpile, many market players are happy enough to see crypto becoming a significant campaign talking point. ""There's a general view in the industry that both parties are paying much more attention to digital assets,"" said Rahul Mewawalla, CEO of Mawson Infrastructure Group   which operates data centers for bitcoin mining. ""The expectation is that will continue post November."""

The commodity-linked TSX has advanced 10.3% since the start of the year, helped by record high gold prices and moves by major central banks, including the Bank of Canada, to lower borrowing costs.

The Bank of Canada has cut its benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points twice since June, lowering the rate to 4.50%. Investors expect nearly 200 basis points of additional easing by the end of 2025 and the U.S. Federal Reserve to begin cutting interest rates next month. , Of 15 analysts who answered a separate question, 10 said Canadian corporate earnings would underperform expectations for the rest of 2024.

Bullion, traditionally known as a favoured hedge against geopolitical and economic risks, tends to thrive in a low-interest-rate environment. Traders now await Friday's U.S. payrolls report for more cues on the Fed's policy path. At the same time, central bank buying and physical demand in Asia are still subdued, ""so right now the gold market is not running on all cylinders but at some point, we suspect that it will,"" Melek added. ""Central bank gold demand should stay high in 2024/2025 despite the recent absence of 'reported' PBOC gold purchases in May and June,"" analysts at Citi wrote in a note. China's central bank, the largest official sector buyer of gold in 2023, refrained from gold purchases to its reserves for a second consecutive month in June. Spot silver fell 2.4% to $28.33, platinum lost 1.3% to $963.05, palladium dropped 2.2% to $904.71."
Golden rule: Why younger investors are drawn to gold,"['markets', 'wealth', '']",", Chris Taylor",Editing by Lauren Young,"NEW YORK, July 18 (Reuters) - What asset class do millennials and Gen Z investors both want to own? Here is an answer you may not have guessed: Gold. Among wealthy investors under the age of 43, 45% own gold as a physical asset, and another 45% are interested in holding it, according to a recent study by Bank of America Private Bank. Those are far higher percentages than other age groups. Usually this demographic is not interested in assets like gold, cash or Treasuries, because they are considered to be ""boring,"" says Liz Young Thomas, head of investment strategy for digital financial services firm SoFi. ""As Treasury yields rise, cash is paying a high interest rate, and gold is rising along with it. We are seeing returns we normally don’t see in such a short period of time,"" Thomas says. ""Naturally, when assets have strong returns, younger audiences start to perk up.” This confirms another study by money managers State Street, which finds that millennials have the highest allocation to gold in their portfolios, at 17%, far outpacing both boomers and Gen X at 10%. So what is going on? Why are younger investors so intrigued by a somewhat stodgy asset that has been around for thousands of years? Part of gold’s renewed buzz is its healthy spot price, which as of this writing  . It is also increasingly on the shelves in popular retail environments, which boosts visibility. Big-box chain Costco started selling 1-oz gold bars last fall and has been doing a brisk trade of up to $200 million monthly, according to Wells Fargo estimates. Since younger investors’ interest has been piqued, what golden rules should they keep in mind? A few thoughts from the experts: Part of the appeal of gold is that it is tangible. If the world’s financial system happens to go haywire, or currencies collapse, at least you would have something real to hold onto. “I have found with my millennial clients that as they get wealthier, they are more interested in investing in directly-held, self-custodied gold,” says Eric Amzalag, a financial planner in Canoga Park, California, whose clients tend to use online precious metals retailer APMEX. That is because investment goals often shift from growth to capital preservation, Amzalag adds. With physical gold you have unique challenges like: finding a reputable dealer who won’t take advantage of you; getting it delivered and stored securely; insuring your purchase; And then figuring out how to eventually sell it, since Costco is not about to buy that gold bar back from you. To protect your portfolio, check out   from the World Gold Council. An exchange-traded fund – either backed by physical gold, or one that invests in gold futures – takes away the problems of buying, storing and selling. It also makes asset exposure relatively easy. “There are some fees associated with that, but ETFs are a nice alternative if you don’t want to actually take delivery of bullion and hold it in your basement,” says SoFi’s Thomas. The largest such ETF, SPDR Gold Shares ( ), carries an expense ratio of 0.4% and boasts one-year returns of more than 23%. A similar approach is to buy an ETF comprised of mining stocks, such as VanEck Gold Miners ( ), which includes the biggest names in the sector like Newmont Corp. and Barrick Gold. Gold can certainly serve a purpose in a portfolio, as an uncorrelated asset and a potential hedge against inflation or volatility. But, as a commodity, it can also be quite volatile and fall in and out of favor with investors. As such, equities should still be the main portfolio entrée for most investors, experts say. Companies that generate sales, earn profits, pay dividends and offer potential share-price appreciation make for a more dynamic asset class with superior long-term returns. As for gold, younger investors may keep it as a complementary side dish, says Jonathan Cameron, a financial planner in Miami. “We work with many young professionals, and we have been including a gold ETF (about 5%) in many of our clients’ portfolios as a hedge for several years,” Cameron says. “Everyone likes this decision.”"
"Global stock index falls with bond yields, dollar after US inflation data","['markets', '']",", Sinéad Carew,   , Marc Jones","Additional reporting by Sinéad Carew, Noel Randewich, Karen Brettell, Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss, Marc Jones in London, Tom Westbrook in Singapore; editing by David Evans, Chris Reese, Diane Craft and Rod Nickel","NEW YORK/LONDON, July 11 (Reuters) - A global index of stocks edged down and bond yields fell on Thursday after U.S. inflation data boosted bets on interest-rate cuts while the yen surged against the dollar, raising questions about whether Japan intervened to boost its currency. U.S. Treasury yields dropped across the board after   unexpectedly slipped 0.1% in June after being unchanged in May, while the annual increase was the smallest in a year, reinforcing views that inflation was abating. The report followed U.S. Federal Reserve Chair   to lawmakers on Capitol Hill that ""more good data"" would build the case for interest-rate cuts. ""The CPI print is the big macro driver today. Any way you look it's encouraging news. It's further evidence that basically gets the Fed across the finish line to that level of confidence to initiate rate cuts,"" said Garrett Melson, portfolio strategist at Natixis in Boston. Despite the supportive data,   two biggest indexes fell as investors rotated into lower-weighted interest-rate-sensitive sectors such as real estate   and utilities   and out of heavy-weight sectors such as technology  , which has already rallied this year. The interest-rate-sensitive small cap Russell 2000 index   rallied more than 3%. Since investors now believe that the Fed is ready to start cutting interest rates, Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research suggested they are already placing their bets without having to ""wait for them to actually do it."" The Dow Jones Industrial Average   rose 32.39 points, or 0.08%, to 39,753.75. But the S&P 500   lost 49.37 points, or 0.88%, to 5,584.54 and the Nasdaq Composite   lost 364.04 points, or 1.95%, to 18,283.41, with both snapping long winning streaks. The benchmark S&P's decline followed six straight record-high closes while the Nasdaq's retreat on Thursday ended a seven-session streak of closing records. MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe   fell 0.76 points, or 0.09%, to 824.01 after rising about 0.7% to a record high earlier in the day. Europe's STOXX 600   index earlier closed up 0.6%. In  , the dollar dropped, with the Japanese yen at one point gaining more than 2% against the greenback as traders priced in the likelihood of U.S. rate cuts. The yen move was so steep that there was speculation about whether Japan had moved to shore up the currency, which fell last week to a 38-year low against the greenback. Japan's TV Asahi, citing government sources, reported that Japanese authorities had intervened. But the country's top currency diplomat Masato Kanda said he was not in position to comment on whether authorities had intervened, according to a Jiji Press report. The dollar index , which measures the greenback against a basket of currencies including the yen and the euro, fell 0.48% to 104.47. The euro was up 0.31% at $1.0864. Against the Japanese yen , the dollar weakened 1.75% at 158.84. And Sterling strengthened 0.51% at $1.291 after hitting an almost one-year high as comments from   policymakers and better-than-forecast GDP data led traders to reduce bets on an August rate cut in Britain. In Treasuries, after the inflation data U.S. two-year to 10-year yields slid to their lowest since mid-March, while those on 20-year and 30-year bonds sagged to two-week troughs. The yield on benchmark U.S. 10-year notes fell 7.4 basis points to 4.206%, from 4.28% late on Wednesday. The 30-year bond yield fell 5.6 basis points to 4.4144% from 4.47% late on Wednesday.

In commodity trading,   edged higher after the inflation data. U.S. crude settled up 0.6%, or 52 cents at $82.62 a barrel and Brent rose to $85.40 per barrel, up 0.4%, or 32 cents. Spot gold , added 1.82% to $2,414.27 an ounce. U.S. gold futures gained 1.77% to $2,414.10 an ounce as the precious metal was bolstered by the prospect of rate cuts."
"Exclusive: Traders face $1 billion loss on faltering Ghana cocoa supply, sources say","['markets', 'commodities', '']",", Maytaal Angel,   , Maxwell Akalaare Adombila","Reporting by Maytaal Angel in London, Maxwell Akalaari Adombile in Accra, and Ange Aboa in Abidjan; Editing by Dmitry Zhdannikov and Emelia Sithole-Matarise","LONDON/ACCRA, July 15 (Reuters) - Trading houses face losses of at least $1 billion on cocoa derivatives after major producer Ghana failed to deliver beans this year, forcing traders to liquidate short positions in a rallying market, six industry sources told Reuters. Global cocoa prices soared this year after bad weather, bean disease, smuggling and illegal gold mining reduced production and the volume of beans available in Ghana, the world's No.2 producer. Chocolate prices also rose globally and chocolate makers have reduced the size of products such as bars as a result of the huge cocoa price increase. Ghanaian authorities, who sell all of the country's beans, want to delay delivery of up to   this season - nearly half of the cocoa beans they sold - due to Ghana's devastated crop, five sources told Reuters last month. Ghana's cocoa regulator said the country was looking to roll over ""some volumes, but not in those quantities"". A delay of 350,000 tons means cocoa traders and processors could face losses of about $4,000 per ton on cocoa futures they had bought to hedge their physical bean purchases, or around $1.4 billion combined, the sources said. Trade houses like Cargill [RIC:RIC:CARG.UL], Olam   and Barry Callebaut   use the futures market to hedge or lock in a price for cocoa they have not yet sold on to chocolate makers. ""We're sitting staring at our screens, barely trading,"" said the head cocoa trader at a global trading house specialising in agricultural commodities, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorised to talk to the media. He said trading in the global cocoa physical and futures market has just about ground to a halt as a result of the deep losses and uncertainty. Much of Ghana's cocoa is bought by large, diversified trade houses with deep pockets, including Sucden, Olam, Barry Callebaut  , Cargill, Touton and Ecom. Traders typically sign deals to buy beans - like any other commodity - months in advance in the hope of reselling later at a profit. By doing so they take a so called long position in the physical market. As they wait for the physical commodity to be delivered for weeks or months they need to protect themselves against possible price falls. They typically do this by taking short positions in the futures market to protect against losses on a long position. Short trading bets on price falls so when the physical commodity arrives, long and short positions cancel each other out, guaranteeing a fixed price. The strategy unravels, however, if physical delivery - in this case cocoa beans - is delayed in a rallying market. If this happens, traders are forced to liquidate short positions for the month they had expected the commodity to arrive and take a new short position for the month of a new expected delivery. Doing so in April 2024 - after the market realised Ghana would delay bean delivery to 2025 - would have been costly, according to the traders. The six sources said last year traders who bought physical beans for May 2024 delivery would have taken equivalent short positions in May 2024 futures at around $3,000 a ton. With the market rallying in April 2024, those traders had to liquidate May 2024 shorts - or buy the futures back - at $11,000 a ton, facing losses of $8,000 a ton. As traders still hope to get the cocoa and need to protect themselves in the physical market, they had to take on new short positions for May 2025 delivery, which in April 2024 traded around $7,000 a ton. That means that if and when traders get their physical cocoa next May at $3,000 a ton, they will still face an aggregate loss of $4,000 per ton. The cocoa market is facing a third successive year of deficit and prices have roughly doubled this year. Traders will try to recoup at least some of their losses by charging chocolate makers like Hershey   and Mondelez   higher prices for products like cocoa powder and butter, said a top trader at a global agri-commodity trade house. Chocolate firms will likely struggle to pass on these costs to cash-strapped consumers who are already buying   in response to price rises. Market liquidity has also decreased because of exchanges asking traders to post more cash as collateral to cover their hedges, one of the traders said. This liquidity crunch has fuelled price fluctuations or volatility, he added. The collateral, known as a margin call, is set by the futures exchange as a down payment that covers a portion of the potential losses traders might face on their futures position. The higher the futures price, the higher the margin calls."

Investors were waiting to listen to Powell's comments to Congress on Tuesday and Wednesday for more clarity on the prospects for interest rate cuts by the U.S. central bank. They were also waiting for the closely monitored U.S. consumer price report, which is due on Thursday. June's inflation rate is expected to slow to 3.1% year-over-year, from 3.3% in May, and the core measure is estimated by economists to stay steady at 3.4%.

India inflation seen up in June due to soaring vegetable prices: Reuters poll,"['world', 'india', '']",", Vivek Mishra","Additional reporting by Anant Chandak; Polling by Susobhan Sarkar and Rahul Trivedi; Editing by Hari Kishan, Ross Finley and Tomasz Janowski","BENGALURU, July 9 (Reuters) - India consumer price inflation probably edged up in June, snapping five months of declines, largely because of a jump in vegetable prices caused by the damage to crops wrought by extreme weather, according to a Reuters poll of economists. Prices of tomatoes, onions, and potatoes - staples in every Indian kitchen - surged by double digits last month as extreme heat and   in   disrupted agricultural production. The July 5-9 Reuters poll of 54 economists forecast consumer price inflation   rose to 4.80% last month on a year earlier, up from 4.75% in May. Food accounts for around half the overall CPI basket. Forecasts for the data, due on July 12 at 1200 GMT, ranged from 4.10% to 5.19%. ""A sharp spike in vegetable prices along with cereals and pulses kept food inflation at higher levels and nullified the softness in eggs, fruits, and spices prices,"" said Kanika Pasricha, chief economic advisor at Union Bank of India. ""Core inflation likely stayed flat at all-time lows of 3.10% as gold prices eased somewhat during the month and commodity prices also remained under pressure."" Core inflation, which excludes volatile items, such as food and energy and is seen as a better gauge of domestic demand, was forecast to be 3.10% in June, according to the median estimate from a smaller sample of 19 economists. The Indian statistics agency does not publish core inflation data, but economists estimate the figure based on CPI data and some may publish their updated estimates after Friday's release. Many economists say despite the economy growing by more than 8%  , the recent decline in core inflation indicates overall weak domestic demand in an economy where private consumption accounts for nearly 60% of GDP. Some also said a   effective from this month is likely to exert upward pressure on inflation over the coming months, arresting a further fall in core CPI. ""Given the weight in the CPI basket (for telecoms) and past translation trends, this should push up headline CPI by another 20 bps or so, starting July,"" said Sajjid Chinoy, chief India economist at J.P. Morgan. ""To the extent that this is a one-off price hike, the RBI should look through this. But again, it adds to the uncertainty of the inflation outlook."" With inflation expected to stay above the Reserve Bank of India's 4% medium-term target   year and next, the central bank is forecast to   just once this year, next quarter. The   is forecast by economists to begin its easing cycle in September. Wholesale price index-based inflation likely surged to an annual 3.50% last month from 2.61% in May, the survey showed."
