China's gold reserves unchanged for fifth straight month in September,"['markets', 'commodities', '']",", Reuters","Reporting by Qiaoyi Li, Ryan Woo and Casey Hall; Editing by Muralikumar Anantharaman & Shri Navaratnam","SHANGHAI, Oct 7 (Reuters) - China's central bank held back on buying gold for its reserves for a fifth straight month in September, official data showed on Monday, mainly due to a surge in prices for the yellow metal. China's gold holdings stood at 72.8 million troy ounces at the end of last month. The value of the gold reserves, however, rose to $191.47 billion from $182.98 billion at the end of August. Gold prices have risen around 28% so far this year - heading for the biggest annual gain in 14 years - underpinned by the start of U.S. Federal Reserve interest rate cuts, geopolitical tensions and robust demand from central banks. Global central banks, which actively bought gold in 2022-2023, are on track to slow purchases in 2024 from 2023, according to the World Gold Council, but to keep them above the pre-2022 level. This is partly due to the pause in purchases by the People's Bank of China (PBOC), which until May had bought gold for 18 consecutive months. The central bank was the world's largest official sector buyer of gold in 2023 and its decision to put its buying on hold muted Chinese   in recent months. ""With higher gold prices, the PBOC continues to pause from new purchases. We believe the central bank would like more gold but is waiting for a more attractive entry point,"" said WisdomTree commodity strategist Nitesh Shah. ""However, with global interest rates falling and geopolitical tensions rising, it looks like they may have to wait for some time for a price dip. Given our forecast of prices rising to over $3,000/oz in the coming year, the central bank may want to consider building positions earlier."""

"Miners, investors see scope in energy transition but struggle with choices: Russell","['markets', 'commodities', '']",", Clyde Russell",Editing by Miral Fahmy,"SINGAPORE, Sept 25 (Reuters) - Mining investment conferences have a great track record of pointing to the next growth area for commodities, as they bring together early stage investors and junior miners seeking to get projects off the ground. A decade ago lithium was the popular metal, five years ago it was the turn of gold and more recently copper has been the flavour of the month at these events across Asia. But at the 121 Mining and Energy Investment conference this week in Singapore there was no clear choice, and no real consensus on where the best opportunities lie. If there was a broad theme, it was that the energy transition is real and happening, even if it will take place at varying speeds and in different forms across Asia, the world's most populous region and the engine room of global economic growth. But how best to leverage the energy transition into profitable investments is turning into a vexing challenge for both those with cash to splash and those seeking to develop projects aimed at accelerating the change to cleaner fuels and power systems. One of the surprising metals on the radar screen at the conference was lithium. It went out of favour in recent years after a surge in investment took the market into surplus, resulting in a collapse of prices, which have dropped some 88% since reaching a record high in December 2022. The thinking is that while the lithium market is currently oversupplied, and this may persist into 2025, there is a wave of new demand coming. Much of the bearishness surrounding lithium has been about the slower-than-expected uptake of electric vehicles in the developed world. But while sales may have been disappointing, lithium demand is set for strong increases in the next few years as electric heavy vehicles enter service, and as battery storage to firm renewables such as wind and solar become more widespread. It's this demand for lithium that will end up trumping any weakness in EV car sales, and it's set to accelerate strongly by 2030, which is coincidently around the time a mining company may be able to bring on new production assuming they started development soon. Another out of favour commodity is coal, but there was interest expressed in metallurgical, or coking coal, the higher quality fuel used mainly to make steel. In effect this is an India play, with the expectation that as it continues its massive infrastructure build out, the South Asian nation will also produce more steel, and thus need to import coking coal given the lack of domestic resources. While coal is the bogeyman of climate change, the view among some investors is that given the energy transition relies heavily on steel, coking coal can be acceptable given its role in producing steel. Steel can be de-carbonised by upgrading iron ore using green hydrogen and then using electric arc furnaces, but the view is that this will take several decades to reach the scale needed, and in the meantime the coal-intensive, traditional basic oxygen furnace method will dominate in India, as it does in China. Another part of the commodity complex attracting investor interest is the midstream sector, where raw materials are processed into intermediate goods. The desire of Western countries to diversify away from China's dominance of metal processing is unlocking opportunities, such as the capital available from the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act. The trick is navigating the bureaucratic processes behind the various global legislations, and even if the money can be accessed, it still may not be enough to overcome China's economies of scale and first mover advantages. For example, setting up a lithium processing plant in Australia, the world's biggest producer of the battery metal, is likely to come in at up to eight times the capital and operating cost of a similar operation in China. Accessing capital remains an ongoing struggle, with both investors and miners saying the pools of available capital are shrinking, especially if Chinese money is deemed politically unacceptable. This means that smaller projects are increasingly turning to intermediaries to obtain funding, such as global trading houses such as Glencore and Trafigura. Banks will lend to these well-established companies, and they in turn will lend to smaller-scale projects. But the problem with this process is that it increases the cost of capital and slows down the pace at which new projects can be brought on line. The bottom line is that the energy transition is viewed as offering huge opportunities to miners, traders and investors, but it remains plagued by uncertainty over which technologies will emerge as the leaders, and also the lack of coordinated government policies such as incentives and carbon taxes.

The Brazilian farmers who are trying to keep the world in its coffee habit despite climate change,"['sustainability', '']",", Terry Slavin",Thomson Reuters,"September 16 - Marcelo Montanari likes to say he was born under a coffee tree. In the four generations that his family has farmed coffee in Brazil after emigrating from Italy 130 years ago, the Motanaris had to relocate four times, when farming became unviable for either political or climate reasons. The last move, to the Cerrado Mineiro region of Minas Gerais, was in 1975, when frost wiped out the crop in the state of Parana, then one of the country’s largest coffee-growing areas. It was an event felt by coffee lovers around the world as the price of their daily java doubled. Arabica coffee is second only to petroleum as the most valuable traded and consumed commodity worldwide. Unlike petroleum, however, there is no risk of flagging demand in the future, with burgeoning middle classes in Asia fast developing a coffee habit. In China, for example, coffee imports grew 30% in the first half of this year alone. And Montanari and his neighbours are at the heart of its production, with Brazil supplying almost half of the world’s demand, most of it from the Cerrado, a vast high savannah where coffee is harvested mechanically on plantations of up to 1,000 hectares – unlike the small plots where it is laboriously handpicked by smallholders in mountainous countries like Colombia. Yet the crop is everywhere under an   as climate change causes extreme weather events and rainfall becomes more erratic, playing havoc with yields. Areas suitable for coffee could  according to climate simulations, and arabica is most at risk, requiring temperatures between 18 degrees Celsius and 23C, and altitudes between 1,000 and 2,000 metres. That puts Cerrado Mineiro, where coffee is grown at altitudes of 900-1,250m, at the lower edge of viability, as I learned on a press trip with Nespresso to the region last September. But 44-year-old Montanari, who trained as an agronomist 20 years ago, is determined not to move again, and believes the key to bolstering the climate-resilience of his coffee crops is through regenerative agriculture. For the past 10 years he has worked to introduce regenerative methods on his 250-hectare farm, dramatically reducing the use of chemical fertilisers and pesticides by replacing them with biological alternatives and integrated pest management. Under , it’s mandatory for the country’s landowners to keep 20% of their property for natural vegetation, but on Montanari’s farm, it is nearly double that, at 36%. While coffee is grown in the full sun, rows of coffee plants are interspersed with native trees, including indigenous mahogany trees, which are commercially valuable, and give him a financial buffer. More importantly, the trees he has planted provide critically important resilience to the drought conditions that the region has been experiencing, Montanari says, with 30 days of water reserves in his ponds, far more than neighbours who are using traditional methods. “We take a holistic view with everything we are doing. We view the plantation of coffee as just one part of an entire ecosystem,” Montanari says. “I like to say our business here isn’t producing coffee. It’s a factory of photosynthesis.” Montanari may have pioneered regenerative agriculture in the region, but he is no longer alone. His farm is one of 68 in the Cerrado Coffee Farmers Cooperative (Expocaccer), centred around the town of Patrocínio, that have been certified as regenerative by Regenagri, a global organisation that aims to guarantee the health and preservation of the soil, and certified by Control Union UK. Last year Italian coffee brand Illycaffe received full Chain of Custody certification from Regenagri for its Brazilian coffee, and launched a Cerrado Mineiro Regenerative Agriculture coffee product globally. But it is Nespresso that Montanari has been working with longest and most closely, first through the company’s triple A sustainable sourcing programme, and since 2020 on its pledge to go beyond triple A and convert 95% of the 150,000 farms it sources from to regenerative practices by 2030.   is also working to convert its entire coffee supply chain to regenerative agriculture, but over a longer time frame. Nestle is doing so in partnership with Rainforest Alliance, which, in the absence of a universally agreed definition, defines regenerative agriculture as a series of practices that promote soil health, conserve biodiversity, restore ecosystems and improve livelihoods. The international NGO has created a   for coffee to certify suppliers, who move through three different levels of bronze, silver and gold. Last year, even bronze-level activities such as more targeted fertiliser use and cover crops resulted in a 5% to 25% increase in coffee productivity per hectare, and 15%-30% lower greenhouse gas emissions across the countries that Nestle sources from,  . The next day we met another of Nespresso’s gold-level suppliers near Patrocinio: Paula Curiacos Urtado and Marcelo Cocco Urtado of Fazenda Tres Meninas, a 54-hectare coffee farm, which the couple bought in 2016. Marcelo, who has a master’s degree in environmental technology and is from a four-generation coffee family, and Paula, a zoo technician, decided to buy Tres Meninas after an unsuccessful effort to introduce more regenerative techniques on the farm owned by Marcelo’s family. “Here we could do what we believed we needed to do” to rescue the soil, which was depleted from years of high dependency on chemical inputs, Marcelo said. The Urtados decided to use 100% natural methods to nourish the soil and fight the pests and fungal diseases that can blight coffee crops – a step beyond even Rainforest Alliance’s gold level, where limited chemical inputs are allowed. They are also renewably powered, with a large solar power installation. Our visit was shortly after the coffee cherries had been harvested, and cover crops grew chest-high between the serried rows. On a tour of the farm, Marcelo explained how they use a mixture of five or six cover crops, because they each bring different benefits to the soil. “Some plants fix nitrogen to the soil, others bring potassium from the soil to the surface,” he said. Others attract insects that are natural predators to the pests that feed on coffee plants. Cover crops also protect plants from overheating during the summer and from frost in winter, shielding them in 2022, when both evils hit Brazilian coffee farmers hard during the same growing season. He illustrated the point by showing a temperature reading of soil on one of the farm’s dirt roads. At 42 degrees Celsius the reading was 15C higher than the 27C from the ground between the planted rows. Marcelo explained that native shrubs and trees interspersed between the coffee rows are at different levels of canopy, to break the wind and prevent the spread of fungi and diseases. Sets of bee houses are also placed every 4 hectares, to do the crucial work of pollinating the coffee bushes when they flower and, Paula maintains, imparting a lovely flavour. One big barrier the couple had to overcome was how could they mechanically extract weeds – necessary if they weren’t using herbicides – and also harvest the ripe coffee cherries without damaging the cover crops. But this was solved with a little engineering ingenuity: Marcelo showed us the farm machinery he had doctored to push the cover crops temporarily aside, allowing them to spring back once the machine has passed. Like Montanari’s farm, Tres Minenas is a living laboratory: from the beginning the couple has disseminated data with universities and welcomed students and other farmers to visit and learn from them. Such farmer advocacy is critical if regenerative agriculture is going to scale, says Julie Dubost de Ferron, global head of Nespresso’s corporate communications. In Brazil, Nespresso employs 24 agronomists, who supply farmers with training, along with native trees for agroforestry and new coffee varieties that have been bred to be more resistant to disease and drought. But it takes more than that to convince ageing and conservative-minded farmers, who like Montanari’s family, have been farming the same land for generations, to abandon age-old practices, she says. “In Colombia, farmers grow up thinking you have to have a ‘clean farm’, taking everything else out of the soil because it competes with the coffee crop (for nutrients),” De Ferron says. “There’s a lot of training (needed) to explain that some plants help the coffee; they don’t compete with it. So agronomists are important, but what works best is having another farmer share (their) experience.” Paula hears a litany of concerns from the farmers she speaks to. She says one farmer may visit a larger regenerative farm, such as Montanari’s, and say the method is only suitable for big, profitable farms. Others might come to Tres Meninas and think it is too small, and such practices can’t be scaled up. But, she said, “It’s not about the size (of the farm). It’s about the mindset (of the farmer). It is scalable, for everybody. They just need to adapt it to their situation.” The biggest change in mindset has been to let go of the idea that farmers should maximise their coffee-planting area, says Cecilia Seravalli Soares, head of sustainability marketing at Nestle Brazil. While increasing productivity was the goal of the triple A programme, she says, regenerative agriculture is about planting fewer, higher-yielding coffee plants to make room for greater plant diversity on a farm. “We tell them, you don’t have to produce so much coffee, planting in every area of the farm, but what you do plant has to be more profitable,” she says. “Regenerative helps the farmers to earn more money, and reduce the cost of running the farm, over the long term.” Paula said that for the first five years, as they were getting established, the cost of production was about 20% higher than conventional farms. “Now, we have the same cost of production, but we are much more resilient,” she says. Their yields, of about 50 bags per hectare, are much higher than the Brazilian average. And they are able to sell it at higher prices to Expocaccer and Nespresso. Montanari's farm and Tres Meninas were among the first five farms to be certified by Regenagri when it started three years ago. But a small yet growing number of Brazilian coffee farmers are also doing the maths. Franco Costantini, CEO and founder of Regenagri, says coffee grew on 45,335 hectares of land certified by Regenagri in Brazil in 2023 – three times the uptake in 2022. Still, the 20% drop in income the Urtados experienced during the transition period is no something that is affordable to the  who depend on the coffee industry for their livelihoods, 70% of them smallholders farming less than five hectares of land. De Ferron says that in countries like Colombia there is additional help with crop insurance, microfinance and provision of pensions, so older farmers can afford to retire. And in Indonesia, Nestle recently launched a weather insurance programme, in partnership with climate insurance specialist Blue Marble, that will insure 800 smallholder coffee farmers for unpredictable weather patterns, such as rainfall and drought, using satellite-based climate data. “The future of coffee is in danger. We strongly believe that regenerative agriculture is how we protect it,” says De Ferron. “But it’s not a small thing for us, or for the coffee industry as a whole. And it definitely isn’t a small thing for the coffee farmers. It’s risky because even if you have a more diversified income (from agroforestry), you still have to get your income from coffee.” But what of the prospect of coffee farmers being able to generate an additional income for the CO2 they have mitigated through carbon markets? Paula says there will need to be further development in measurement protocols, including to ensure that a farm like theirs is rewarded for the huge gains they made before entering Regenagri’s programme. According to  , coffee grown on its certified farms in Brazil showed a reduction of 1.99 tonnes of CO2 equivalent per tonne of coffee, taking into account lower greenhouse gas emissions, primarily from reduced chemical usage, and higher biomass sequestration, compared with conventionally produced coffee. Average water reduction per tonne of coffee was 43,368 litres. In May it launched a new insetting standard that companies such as Illycaffe and Nestle will be able to use to make quantifiable claims in sustainability reports that they are reducing the climate impacts in their supply chains. It could also be the basis for an insetting credit market, which is being considered by the Greenhouse Gas Protocol. ( ) “Scale is coming because of the value of the programme for the whole supply chain,” says Regenagri’s Costantini. But like the offsetting market, which has been rocked by credibility issues, insetting carries risks of double counting and lack of permanence if a natural disaster struck a farm, for example, washing away soil or if land use changed , he says. So there will need to be strong standards and a strict mechanism to ensure no misuse of invalid claims. The key problem, though, is that finance from both insetting and offsetting markets could only come a few years down the track. As Santiago Gowland, CEO of Rainforest Alliance, points out, what farmers need is upfront finance, such as low-interest loans. He talks about  , a Vietnamese coffee farmer, who struggled financially for the first couple of years as he experimented with getting the right mix of intercropped plants, such as durian and macadamia trees, alongside his coffee plants, but by year three saw a 25% decrease in costs from fewer chemical inputs, and an increase of 35% in profits, from being able to sell his coffee for higher prices. Together with the additional income from durian and macadamia, he is today earning about 40% more than his neighbours. Gowland says one way Rainforest Alliance is looking to try to help bridge that gap is through innovative partnerships, as it recently struck with  , which aims to raise 350 million euros to bring finance solutions to farmers enrolled in its regenerative agriculture programs in Africa, Latin America and Asia. Still, it is a fraction of the U.N.’s   that will need to be invested in nature-based solutions by 2030, a tripling of existing finance. But with coffee such an important export crop for countries such as Brazil, Colombia and Vietnam, Gowland thinks the sector is ripe for blended finance vehicles, where governments and multilateral agencies put in finance to de-risk private sector investment. “When there’s money to unlock, it’s easier to align the finances.” For Montanari, whose daughter is at university studying agronomy, and the Urtados, who have two daughters, what motivates them is the hope that they are still in business, with their children, farming coffee in the next 20 years."

NYSE Arca Gold Miners Index  , which tracks the gold-mining industry, has risen about 20% so far, versus a 16.5% rise in the benchmark S&P 500  . As commodity prices remain strong, the market will be watching for mining companies to demonstrate stability in production and costs in the quarter and discipline and rationality in their growth plans, BMO Capital Markets analyst Jackie Przybylowski said. Barrick, in its quarterly production snapshot last week, said it expects its gold and copper output to progressively increase each quarter through the year with a higher weighting in the second-half. It cited the ramp-up of the Pueblo Viejo project expansion in Dominican Republic and improvements at Nevada Gold Mines for the outlook. With costs holding steady, second-quarter margins (Barrick) are set to benefit from an increase of about $250 per ounce in gold prices sequentially, and anticipate a meaningful operational improvement in the third-quarter, said analysts at Jefferies. Newmont is traditionally weighted to second-half due to weather impacts, Przybylowski said. The top miner is expected to report 1.56 million ounces gold production for second quarter, nearly 26% higher than last year, according to LSEG data. Newmont is expected to report quarterly results on Wednesday, while rival Barrick Gold is scheduled for August 12."

China's gold buying break seen as fleeting given its long-term needs,"['markets', 'commodities', '']",", Polina Devitt,   , Kevin Yao","Reporting by Polina Devitt in London, Kevin Yao in Beijing and Ashitha Shivaprasad in Bengaluru; Editing by Tony Munroe and Jamie Freed","LONDON/BEIJING, July 17 (Reuters) - China still has plenty of appetite for official gold purchases despite pausing in May and June, as its bullion holdings remain low as a share of reserves and geopolitical tensions persist, according to a policy insider, industry experts and data. Beijing's gold buying, which helped the spot price rally in April and May, is no longer perceived to be immune to price sensitivity, but ongoing geopolitical risks are expected to keep its longer-term programme to diversify exposure from U.S. dollar-denominated assets active. China's gold reserves need to rise in absolute and relative terms because they do not match the status of the world's second-largest economy and gold's share of its reserves is the lowest of any major economy, said a Chinese policy insider involved in internal discussions who declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter. ""But we need to look at prices - it's impossible for the central bank to maintain a constant amount of purchases each month,"" the insider said, adding that geopolitical factors spurred by the Russia-Ukraine war and the Middle East conflict were among drivers of China's gold demand in recent years. Officials at the central bank, the People's Bank of China (PBOC), have never publicly commented on what prompted a resumption in gold buying in November 2022 after a more-than three-year pause. Eight months after Western sanctions froze $300 billion of Russia's official reserves, about half of Moscow's total, the PBOC started reporting gold purchases and kept doing so for 18 months, forming a pillar for global gold prices to hit record highs in 2024. The PBOC was the world's largest single buyer of gold in 2023, with its net purchases of 7.23 million ounces the most by China for at least 46 years, according to the World Gold Council. But when it made no purchases in May and June this year, spot prices came under pressure, leaving the market guessing about China's future appetite. The policy insider attributed the pause in buying to ""high prices"". The spot price, which regained ground after a dip in June, hit a   during trading on Wednesday on improved U.S. rate cut hopes. The PBOC and foreign exchange regulator State Administration of Foreign Exchange did not respond to Reuters' requests for comment. China has the world's largest foreign currency reserves, at $3.22 trillion in June. But gold's share of China's overall reserves, which include its reserve position and special drawing rights (SDRs) at the International Monetary Fund, while at a record high of 4.9% is low compared to the global average of 16%. Developing and emerging market countries typically have a much lower share of gold in reserves than advanced economies, which have smaller currency reserves. ""Given that base and very large scale of FX reserves we believe the PBOC will be buying gold at higher volumes for decades,"" said Nitesh Shah, commodity strategist at WisdomTree. Demand from investors in China is also set to stay strong, he said, amid a prolonged property crisis and as central bank purchases give confidence in gold as a store of value. ""The official sector buying is a free advertisement for gold in China,"" said Shaokai Fan, global head of the central banks sector at the World Gold Council. ""In the sense that if the central bank is buying gold, maybe I, as a retail investor, shall buy some too."" Putting more reserves in gold is a matter of security because bullion can be stored onshore - safe from seizure. Officially, Russia's gold is 30% of its $597 billion reserves, but in terms of accessible assets the share is much bigger as half of Russia's reserves were frozen by Western countries in reaction to Moscow's invasion of Ukraine in 2022. That precedent, in which Russia's central bank kept access only to investments in yuan-denominated assets and gold, has served as a cautionary tale for China, which has an estimated 60% of its reserves in U.S. dollar-denominated assets, according to analysts. ""The main motivation of the PBOC is to be less dependent on the U.S. dollar and – in an extreme case – to be less susceptible to U.S. sanctions,"" said Carsten Menke, analyst at Julius Baer. He expects China's desire to diversify reserves to persist as ""the geopolitical tensions between China and the United States are unlikely to disappear anytime soon, independent of the outcome of the U.S. presidential elections."" It took China nine years to raise the share of gold in its total reserves to 4.9% from 1.8% in 2015. China holds 72.8 million ounces of gold worth about $170 billion. If it eventually lifted the share of gold in its reserves even to 10% at current reserve levels and prices, the purchases would total another $170 billion. For comparison, Russia's central bank stopped active buying of the precious metal in 2020 when gold reached 20% of its total reserves. Gold's share has since grown due in part to its rising price. The PBOC has sometimes reported past gold purchases well after they occurred, according to the World Gold Council, leading analysts to caution the latest statistics may not provide the full picture."

India inflation seen up in June due to soaring vegetable prices: Reuters poll,"['world', 'india', '']",", Vivek Mishra","Additional reporting by Anant Chandak; Polling by Susobhan Sarkar and Rahul Trivedi; Editing by Hari Kishan, Ross Finley and Tomasz Janowski","BENGALURU, July 9 (Reuters) - India consumer price inflation probably edged up in June, snapping five months of declines, largely because of a jump in vegetable prices caused by the damage to crops wrought by extreme weather, according to a Reuters poll of economists. Prices of tomatoes, onions, and potatoes - staples in every Indian kitchen - surged by double digits last month as extreme heat and   in   disrupted agricultural production. The July 5-9 Reuters poll of 54 economists forecast consumer price inflation   rose to 4.80% last month on a year earlier, up from 4.75% in May. Food accounts for around half the overall CPI basket. Forecasts for the data, due on July 12 at 1200 GMT, ranged from 4.10% to 5.19%. ""A sharp spike in vegetable prices along with cereals and pulses kept food inflation at higher levels and nullified the softness in eggs, fruits, and spices prices,"" said Kanika Pasricha, chief economic advisor at Union Bank of India. ""Core inflation likely stayed flat at all-time lows of 3.10% as gold prices eased somewhat during the month and commodity prices also remained under pressure."" Core inflation, which excludes volatile items, such as food and energy and is seen as a better gauge of domestic demand, was forecast to be 3.10% in June, according to the median estimate from a smaller sample of 19 economists. The Indian statistics agency does not publish core inflation data, but economists estimate the figure based on CPI data and some may publish their updated estimates after Friday's release. Many economists say despite the economy growing by more than 8%  , the recent decline in core inflation indicates overall weak domestic demand in an economy where private consumption accounts for nearly 60% of GDP. Some also said a   effective from this month is likely to exert upward pressure on inflation over the coming months, arresting a further fall in core CPI. ""Given the weight in the CPI basket (for telecoms) and past translation trends, this should push up headline CPI by another 20 bps or so, starting July,"" said Sajjid Chinoy, chief India economist at J.P. Morgan. ""To the extent that this is a one-off price hike, the RBI should look through this. But again, it adds to the uncertainty of the inflation outlook."" With inflation expected to stay above the Reserve Bank of India's 4% medium-term target   year and next, the central bank is forecast to   just once this year, next quarter. The   is forecast by economists to begin its easing cycle in September. Wholesale price index-based inflation likely surged to an annual 3.50% last month from 2.61% in May, the survey showed."

The index had edged up to a near five-week high on Thursday driven by resource companies, pretty much the same basket of stocks that drove the index down in the day. ""The market might be interpreting that as the chances of a recession are higher here in Canada, the chances of a soft landing are lower,"" said Josh Sheluk, chief investment officer at Verecan Capital Management.
